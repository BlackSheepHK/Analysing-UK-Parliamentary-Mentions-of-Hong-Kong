                                  <div class="debate-speech__content">                <p pid=".767.3/1">This is a debate on the <a href="/glossary/?gl=7" title="http://www.the-hutton-inquiry.org.uk/content/report/" class="glossary">Hutton report</a>, but I know that the House will want to range wider than the report itself. I intend to cover four issues: the report itself and its findings; the inquiry into the issue of intelligence announced yesterday; the threat of weapons of mass destruction more generally; and the current situation in Iraq. I shall try to take as many interventions as possible, to allow questions on those issues.</p> <p pid=".767.3/2">The Hutton report did not, of course, consider whether the intelligence that the Government received prior to the war in Iraq was right, but it did examine exhaustively and in painstaking detail two issues: whether Downing street or the Government acted improperly in respect of the September 2002 dossier, and in particular whether the BBC story in respect of it was correct; and whether I or anyone else acted duplicitously or in an underhand manner in respect of the naming of Dr. Kelly.</p> <p pid=".767.3/3">The Hutton report found conclusively that on both counts the answer was no. It did find that the Ministry of Defence was at fault in not telling Dr. Kelly clearly and immediately that his name would be confirmed if a journalist suggested it. Again, as I said last week, we accept those findings, and I am sure that the whole House would want to join me in paying tribute to the dignity with which Mrs. Kelly and her family have conducted themselves during this extremely difficult period.</p> <p pid=".767.3/4">The report itself&#8212;clear, forensic and utterly comprehensive in its analysis of the evidence&#8212;is the best defence to the charges of Government whitewash, often from the same people who just over a week ago were describing <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lord_Hutton">Lord Hutton</a> as a model of impartiality, wisdom and insight. I simply make two points to those who cannot accept that Lord Hutton could acquit the Government of dishonesty. On the principal point, Lord Hutton confirmed the conclusion that the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intelligence_and_Security_Committee">Intelligence and Security Committee</a> had found before him, and the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foreign_Affairs_Committee">Foreign Affairs Committee</a> before it, and the Government published responses to their reports yesterday. It would have been impossible from the evidence, frankly, to find otherwise.</p> <p pid=".767.3/5">I read that there are some who still say that the broadcast by Mr. Gilligan was 90 per cent. right. Actually, it was 100 per cent. wrong. The claim by Mr. Gilligan was that, a) the intelligence about Saddam using some weapons of mass destruction within 45 minutes of an order to do so was inserted into the dossier not by the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joint_Intelligence_Committee">Joint Intelligence Committee</a>, as I told Parliament, but by Downing street; b) that this was done against the express wishes of the intelligence community; c) that it was done by Downing street,</p> <p class="indent" pid=".767.3/6">"probably knowing that it was wrong"; and, furthermore, d) that the source of this unprecedented charge was</p> <p class="indent" pid=".767.3/8">"a senior official in charge of drawing up the dossier".</p> <p pid=".767.3/9">In fact, every single one of those claims was wrong&#8212;not a little wrong, 100 per cent. wrong. The reason why Lord Hutton found as much was that not a single shred of evidence was presented to his inquiry that would have justified an alternative finding. The same is true for the Intelligence and Security Committee and for the Foreign Affairs Committee.</p>            </div>

What I said yesterday, and I shall come to this point later in my speech, is that we obviously have to take account of what Dr. <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Kay">David Kay</a> has said, as the head of the Iraq survey group.

I shall give one example, which is relevant to some of what is in the newspapers today. The concerns by people within <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Defence_Intelligence_Staff">Defence Intelligence Staff</a> about the way in which the 45-minute intelligence was phrased in the dossier, which was after all possibly the grain of truth that led to the mountain of untruth in Mr. Gilligan's broadcast, was reported the next day as leaving the credibility of the dossier in tatters, and the Government's case shot to pieces. One would have thought that the entirety of the Government's case in the dossier had been destroyed after listening to or reading some accounts of the evidence. In fact, one of those who gave evidence to the <a href="/glossary/?gl=17" title="http://www.the-hutton-inquiry.org.uk/" class="glossary">Hutton inquiry</a> said that overall the dossier was</p> <p class="indent" pid=".769.3/3">"a reasonable and accurate picture of the intelligence."</p> <p pid=".769.3/4">It was also revealed to the inquiry that Dr. Kelly himself said that it was "good".</p>            </div>

In the end, he concluded that the way in which the dossier expressed the evidence was right. Incidentally, those concerns&#8212;again, I shall come back to them in a moment&#8212;never came to the full <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joint_Intelligence_Committee">Joint Intelligence Committee</a>, let alone to Downing street. I have no doubt that questions will be asked about whether that was the right way to proceed. Personally, I think that people should be allowed to manage their own departments properly. What cannot be said is that Downing street had anything to do with those concerns. They never came before the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JIC">JIC</a>, let alone Downing street. I totally agree with the right hon. Gentleman that issues may arise about procedures within departments, but those are a million miles away from the allegation that was broadcast&#8212;and I think that he would accept that.</p>            </div>

First, the particular intelligence that she is talking about is not intelligence on the 45 minutes; it was intelligence on the different issue to do with chemical and biological weapons. The <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISC">ISC</a> considered this in its report. It was not seen by everyone within <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DIS">DIS</a>. The procedures of <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SIS">SIS</a> are that where there is a very sensitive source it will go on a restricted access to people, but they were briefed on the details. However, people on the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joint_Intelligence_Committee">Joint Intelligence Committee</a> were able to know exactly what the provenance of that intelligence was and exactly what its significance was. But the point that I was making was that it does not relate to the 45 minutes. What has happened&#8212;it is perfectly understandable, because this gets extremely complicated over time&#8212;is that people have conflated a different piece of intelligence with assuming that there was some secret bit of 45-minute intelligence that was not seen. <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lord_Hutton">Lord Hutton</a> saw all that there was to see on the 45 minutes.</p>            </div>

I shall come in a moment to what Dr. Kay said.</p> <p pid=".773.0/2">I should like to say exactly what the point is that Dr. Jones was making in the course of his evidence. The whole issue was gone into in minute detail by <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lord_Hutton">Lord Hutton</a>. It is true that Dr. Jones was expressing concern about the strength of the language used to describe the 45-minute claim. But it is important also to contextualise that. In his evidence, to be found at page 120 of the <a href="/glossary/?gl=7" title="http://www.the-hutton-inquiry.org.uk/content/report/" class="glossary">Hutton report</a>, he makes it clear in an answer to Lord Hutton that</p> <p class="indent" pid=".773.0/3">"The important point is that we at no stage argued that this intelligence should not be included in the dossier . . . We thought it was important intelligence."</p> <p pid=".773.0/4">In other words, he was not even saying that it should not be in the dossier. He then said that he thought that the references in the foreword</p> <p class="indent" pid=".773.0/5">"were too strong" and that what he believed was that instead of saying that the intelligence "shows" this it should be that the intelligence "indicates" this.</p> <p pid=".773.0/7">I agree that there is a difference between the two. But let us be quite clear. It is hardly of earth-shattering significance in terms of how the whole dossier would be perceived. In any event, I do not pass judgment on whether it was right to say "indicates" or right to say "shows". That judgment was made by the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joint_Intelligence_Committee">Joint Intelligence Committee</a>. It never reached this difference within the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DIS">DIS</a>. In the Joint Intelligence Committee as a committee it did not reach the chairman of the committee, let alone Downing street.</p> <p pid=".773.0/8">Therefore, when people ask why the judge concluded that Downing street had not interfered improperly with the dossier, it was because even on that small issue, which is the only issue that has allowed Mr. Gilligan's claim to have any provenance at all, it never came anywhere near <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Downing_Street">Downing Street</a>.</p>            </div>

There was a bitter situation in Iraq for a long time, and it was caused by a ruthless tyrant who killed literally hundreds of thousands of his people. I know that whatever disagreement my right hon. Friend has with me over the war, she would accept that Iraq is a better place without him.</p> <p pid=".774.3/3">Before I leave the subject of the <a href="/glossary/?gl=7" title="http://www.the-hutton-inquiry.org.uk/content/report/" class="glossary">Hutton report</a> itself, let me make one final observation. Having produced his findings, Lord Hutton has been accused in certain quarters&#8212;we heard that earlier during <a href="/glossary/?gl=264" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prime_Minister_of_the_United_Ki ngdom" class="glossary">Prime Minister</a>'s <a href="/glossary/?gl=25" title="Question Time is an opportunity for MPs and Members of the House of Lords..." class="glossary">Question Time</a>&#8212;of putting at risk the freedom of the press or the independence of the BBC. In fairness to him, we should be clear about what Lord Hutton is saying. What Lord Hutton says is that if an allegation of gross impropriety or dishonesty is made against someone it should be checked out first, or if it is made and turns out to be false, it should be withdrawn. That is not to curtail a free press; it is actually to ensure a free society.</p>            </div>

Gentleman is eliding two separate things. <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lord_Hutton">Lord Hutton</a> found that there was no underhand or duplicitous treatment in respect of the naming of Dr. Kelly. He did find that within the Ministry of Defence Dr. Kelly should have been informed that his name was going to come out. I have already indicated&#8212;I indicated last week&#8212;that we fully accepted those findings and that we will do our best to act on them, but that is an entirely different matter from the allegation that was made against us. Of course, where there have been failings in respect of Dr. Kelly we must take account of them. I also said, however&#8212;and I would like to repeat it&#8212;that some of those officials in the Ministry of Defence, who are good and dedicated public servants, have had the most appalling and difficult time themselves over the past few months. I think we should bear that in mind as well.</p> <p pid=".776.1/2">Let me now turn to whether the intelligence on which we relied, in part, to go to war was correct. Originally, as the House knows, I wanted to wait until the Iraq survey group had reported fully before any investigation occurred. <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Last_Tuesday">Last Tuesday</a>, however, <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Kay">David Kay</a>, the outgoing head of the ISG, gave evidence to the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Senate_Armed_Services_Committee">Senate Armed Services Committee</a> in Washington which, frankly, cannot be ignored. More important still, it is now clear that the ISG itself, under its new chairman, will not make its full report any time soon. <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/President_Bush">President Bush</a> has announced a commission in the United States, and yesterday we announced one here.</p> <p pid=".776.1/3">I want to make clear, incidentally, that I personally would have been happy for the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intelligence_and_Security_Committee">Intelligence and Security Committee</a> to conduct this inquiry. That was within its statutory remit, and it does an excellent job. But I was pressed hard for a committee of the type headed by <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lord_Franks">Lord Franks</a> after the Falklands conflict, and I agreed to that. I might add that I have now looked at the terms of reference for the Franks committee. It is not correct that the committee passed judgment on whether or not the Falklands war was right. It did not do so.</p> <p pid=".776.1/4">As I said, I was pressed hard for a committee of that type, and I agreed. The committee will be able to examine the whole issue to do with intelligence and weapons of mass destruction, the difficulties associated with that across the piece, and of course, on Iraq specifically, any discrepancies between the intelligence gathered, evaluated and used by the Government and what the ISG found.</p>            </div>

                                  <div class="debate-speech__content">                <p pid=".777.9/1">My hon. Friend is absolutely right.</p> <p pid=".777.9/2">I am sorry that the Liberal Democrats felt that they could not participate in the committee, but I cannot accept that the issue of whether the political judgment that led to war was right should be given to a committee. We are the elected politicians; we make the judgment; it is for us to choose, and ultimately for the people to decide. However, I enter one word of caution. It has already been said&#8212;and it surprises me not at all&#8212;that this report will not do either. For some people, it will not. Some who opposed the war will not rest until one inquiry succeeds another, until a final inquiry concludes that it was all a mistake or, even better, a conspiracy. I have given up trying to satisfy that audience.</p> <p pid=".777.9/3">I also have a word of caution for others who rightly want to know whether the intelligence was correct. That word of caution surrounds the evidence of Dr. Kay and what the Iraq survey group has found so far. I accept that it has not found what many others, including Dr. Kay, and I confidently expected they would&#8212;actual weapons ready for immediate use. Let others accept that what it has found are laboratories, technology, diagrams, documents and teams of scientists told to conceal their work on biological, nuclear and chemical weapons capability, which, in sum, amount to breaches of UN resolutions many times over.</p> <p pid=".777.9/4">If we ever want an example of the impossibility of having a balanced debate on the issues, it is the way in which Dr. Kay's comments have been treated. I asked <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Senator_Warner">Senator Warner</a> of the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Senate_Armed_Services_Committee">Senate Armed Services Committee</a> in the United States and he agreed that we could place in the <a href="/glossary/?gl=271" title="See &quot;placed in the library&quot;." class="glossary">Library of the House</a> of Commons the full transcript of Dr. Kay's remarks. I simply ask hon. Members to read it in full.</p> <p pid=".777.9/5">I shall read one or two items from it. First, Dr. Kay says on the subject of breaches of resolution 1441:</p> <p class="indent" pid=".777.9/6">"In my judgment, based on the work that has been done to this point of the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iraq_Survey_Group">Iraq Survey Group</a> . . . Iraq was in clear violation of the terms of <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Resolution_1441">Resolution 1441</a> . . . We have discovered hundreds of cases, based on both documents, physical evidence and the testimony of Iraqis, of activities prohibited under" the UN resolutions.</p> <p pid=".777.9/8">In replying to Senator Warner, he went on to say:</p> <p class="indent" pid=".777.9/9">"I think the world is far safer with the disappearance and removal of Saddam Hussein. I have said I actually think this may be one of those cases where it was even more dangerous than we thought. I think when we have the complete record you're going to discover that after 1998 it became a regime that was totally corrupt. Individuals were out for their own protection. And in a world where we know others are seeking WMD, the likelihood at some point in the future of a seller and a buyer meeting up would have made that a far more dangerous country than even we anticipated".</p> <p pid=".777.9/10">Asked specifically by one Senator whether it would have been better to have allowed the UN inspectors to remain there, Dr. Kay says:</p> <p class="indent" pid=".777.9/11">"All I can say is that among an extensive body of the U.N.&#8212;of Iraqi scientists who were talking to us, they have said: '<a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_U">The U</a>.N. interviewed us. We did not tell them the truth. We did not show them this equipment. We did not talk about these programmes. We couldn't do it as long as Saddam was in power.'"</p> <p pid=".777.9/12">Dr. Kay goes on:</p> <p class="indent" pid=".777.9/13">"I suspect regardless of how long they had stayed, that attitude would have been the same."</p> <p pid=".777.9/14">He goes on to detail information about restarting the nuclear weapons programme, which is even worse than we thought. He continues to talk about mass destruction- related programme activities and goes on to detail how they were attempting to develop <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/VX">VX</a> and anthrax of a more potent sort than we had anticipated. He goes on to give evidence of an unmanned aerial vehicle with a range of 500 km&#8212;way beyond 150 km&#8212;ready to be fitted with exactly the type of sprays used for WMD.</p> <p pid=".777.9/15">Dr. Kay goes on to say that, in addition to all those things, the group discovered even more evidence about a ballistic missile technology that Iraq was trying to develop to produce ballistic missiles of up to 1,000 km.</p>            </div>

                                  <div class="debate-speech__content">                <p pid=".780.3/1">We did pass a great deal of information on to the UN inspectors. However, I say to the hon. Gentleman that they were gravely inhibited in one respect. The single most important thing is to be able to interview the people concerned with the weapons programme. That is why in Libya today we are getting co-operation from the Libyan authorities and we are able to make real progress. Incidentally, I believe that, when we are able to talk about it, people will be surprised at the extent of that progress.</p> <p pid=".780.3/2">What Saddam was doing, however, was effectively refusing to allow the scientists to be interviewed properly. If scientists came to interviews, there would be a tape recorder there, or they were obliged to bring a "friend" to the interview. The fact is, as Dr. Kay said, that Iraqi scientists are on record as saying to him that when Saddam was in power, they did not dare give the information. I am afraid that we are left with the situation where, if people are reasonable, they will have to accept that Saddam retained the full intention of developing the programmes. In the end&#8212;Dr. Kelly himself once made this remark&#8212;Saddam was never going to change. Ultimately, even though we went through the UN and through the business of putting inspectors back into Iraq, he was never going to change unless he was removed from power.</p> <p pid=".780.3/3">Let me make one further comment. Suppose we had accepted Saddam's assurances and left him to get on with it, or suppose the inspections that he had no intention of co-operating with had wound their weary way to nowhere until the world's attention turned away. Do we think that in the chaos and corruption in Iraq that Dr. Kay described and that in the inevitable licence that Saddam would have gained in the face of the world's weakness, the world would be a safer place? Does anyone really believe that? Even if the Iraq survey group finds no more than it has found so far&#8212;incidentally, it still has 26 million pages of documents to read, as well as innumerable sites to visit and scientists to interview&#8212;we would have been irresponsible in the highest degree if we had not acted against Saddam and removed him and his loathsome regime from power.</p> <p pid=".780.3/4">However, I never based the case for war on Iraq alone. Iraq was also an essential test of whether the world was prepared to confront the new security threat that we face&#8212;the nexus between unstable, repressive states that develop WMD and terrorists who seek unlimited destruction in pursuit of fanatical goals. I shall not rehearse every aspect of that argument today, but I repeat my conviction that that nexus between terrorism and WMD is the security threat of the early 21st century.</p> <p pid=".780.3/5">After Afghanistan, and now after Iraq, the world knows that we will fight back. It knows that, wherever the terrorists are, we will get after them, and that we will press hard on states that sponsor terrorism. The pressure that we exert may well be diplomatic pressure, but such states now know that we have the military means at our disposal, and the willingness to use to it if necessary.</p> <p pid=".780.3/6">When states that used to harbour ambitions for WMD reach out to us in friendship, we will reach out to them and offer a way out. That is why I welcome the six-nation talks involving <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_Korea">North Korea</a> that have begun. It is why I am pleased that Iran has recommenced negotiations with the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Atomic_Energy_Authority">International Atomic Energy Authority</a>, and why <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/President_Bush">President Bush</a> and I are prepared to seek a new relationship with Libya. Does anyone seriously believe that we would be better placed in any of those endeavours if we had shied away from confronting Saddam?</p> <p pid=".780.3/7">Also, in respect of each of the nations to which I have just referred, we have acted in part on intelligence. I cannot say&#8212;this bears directly on the point made earlier by <a href="/mp/?m=994" title="Our page on Robert Jackson - 'the hon. Member for Wantage (Mr. Jackson)'">Mr. Jackson</a>&#8212;that all that intelligence is right in every respect. It may even be that we have underestimated the WMD threat in certain quarters. Intelligence never pretends to be an exact science. However, we are very lucky to have our intelligence capability, and we should be proud of the work that our intelligence services do, and of the people who work in them.</p> <p pid=".780.3/8">Therefore, if any part of the intelligence turns out to be wrong&#8212;and we know that much of it was right&#8212;or if the threat from Saddam turns out to be different or to have changed from what we thought, I will accept that, as I should. However, others should accept that ridding Iraq of Saddam Hussein has made the world not just better, but safer. It has hugely strengthened us in our fight against the proliferation of biological, chemical and nuclear weapons. Although the responsibility for going to war is mine, as it should be, it would also have been my responsibility if, having received the intelligence, I had refused to act on it. I know which course lies more easily on my conscience.</p> <p pid=".780.3/9">One very clear reason for that is what is happening in Iraq today&#8212;and I come now to my final point. Yes, the terrorists and the rump of Saddam sympathisers wreak their deathly havoc. Yes, there are still a myriad problems to overcome. But 17,000 construction projects are now under way in Iraq; the oil is flowing, and its wealth is being put back into the hands of Iraqis; the schools and hospitals are open; a new currency is in circulation; a new police force is taking shape, and newspapers and radio stations abound.</p>            </div>

Members wish to speak.</p> <p pid=".782.9/2">We must recognise that the process that has begun in Iraq will give the Iraqi people, for the first time ever, the chance to run their own affairs in a democratic way. I remember that before the conflict, many people, both here and abroad, said that we did not understand what Iraq was like, and that countries such as Iraq preferred hard-line military dictators who were able to keep order. However, people in Iraq now rejoice at the possibility of democracy.</p> <p pid=".782.9/3">That brings me to my final point, which I think is important. Sometimes, the values that we are trying to help Iraqis to achieve are talked about as though they were solely western values. A sort of self-loathing comes upon us when we talk about them in that way, but those values are not only western in origin. They are the values of the human spirit. People support them wherever they can get them. We should be proud that, in Iraq today, we have a process under way that will allow the Iraqi people to achieve the freedom, democracy and the rule of the law that we take for granted.</p> <p pid=".782.9/4">Yes, we will get protests, as we saw earlier today. However, we in this <a href="/glossary/?gl=192" title="The House of Commons is one of the houses of parliament. Here, elected MPs..." class="glossary">House of Commons</a> are very lucky: we can say what we want about the policy issues of the day, and we can debate them properly and come to decisions about them. In the end, the people of this country elect their Government. That is a fantastic thing, and it is an opportunity that is available for people in Iraq today.</p> <p pid=".782.9/5">I know that people&#8212;some of them Labour Members&#8212;are worried about our alliance with the United States of America. However, I think that America now understands and believes that the best and ultimate guarantee of its security is the spread of the values of freedom, democracy and the rule of law. If America no longer takes an isolationist view of the world but considers that part of its job is to spread those values around the world, I for one am proud to be its friend and ally.</p> <p pid=".782.9/6">The values that I have described are important: they are, ultimately, the best guarantee of security. We can have everything that we want in terms of security services and military action, but the best guarantee of our security is that people everywhere in the world are allowed to live their lives in decency and freedom. They must be able to know that the knock on the door does not come from the secret police. They must be able to hold their Governments to account, and to do the same for anyone who transgresses their rights, in courts that are properly run. In the end, that is the freedom that people in Iraq and everywhere else want. It is the freedom that we should be giving to them.</p>            </div>

I agree with what he said about the United States, and about present conditions in Iraq. I agree, too, with what he said about the threats that we face in this dangerous world, and about the necessity to take action to deal with those threats. On all those vitally important matters, there is complete agreement between us.</p> <p pid=".783.0/2">I also welcome the Prime <a href="/glossary/?gl=35" title="Ministers make up the Government and almost all are members of the House of..." class="glossary">Minister</a>'s decision, announced yesterday, to set up an inquiry into the matters to which he has referred. I believe that the war in Iraq was a just war. My party has been consistent in offering support to the Government and our armed forces&#8212;<i>[Interruption.]</i> I remind Labour Members that, if it had not been for our support, the Government would not have had the House's authority to proceed. That is something that should be remembered. We have been equally consistent in calling, since last June, for an inquiry to be held into the intelligence surrounding the war. It is becoming increasingly clear that there was a discrepancy between the intelligence assessment of the weapons of mass destruction which it was believed Saddam Hussein possessed and the reality on the ground. <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Kay">David Kay</a>, whom the Prime Minister quoted frequently in his speech, has said that he does not believe that weapons of mass destruction exist, or existed, in Iraq. He said a number of other things, too&#8212;the Prime Minister is quite right&#8212;and I shall come to some of them.</p> <p pid=".783.0/3">Let me make one thing clear: it is possible both to support the war and to want to get at the truth. That is the position of David Kay; it was the position of the late <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Kelly">David Kelly</a>; and it is my position, too. The purpose of the inquiry that the Prime Minister announced yesterday should not be to find scapegoats in the intelligence service&#8212;I agree with what the Prime Minister said about the enormous contribution that the intelligence services make to our security&#8212;nor should it be to rerun the arguments for war. As David Kay said&#8212;I think the Prime Minister has quoted these words&#8212;</p> <p class="indent" pid=".783.0/4">"the world is a far safer place with the disappearance and removal of Saddam Hussein" and Iraq</p> <p class="indent" pid=".783.0/6">"was even more dangerous than we thought."</p> <p pid=".783.0/7">It is precisely because we live in such a dangerous world, where many threats may be even graver than we currently think, that it is so important that we have the best intelligence possible and the best guarantee that it will be acted on wisely.</p> <p pid=".783.0/8">If it is the case that intelligence overestimated Saddam Hussein's weapons of mass destruction, it is also true that, in the past, intelligence has underestimated threats, not least from Libya and Iraq in the 1990s. Underestimating the dangers we face should be at least as big a concern as overestimating them. I agree with my hon. Friend <a href="/mp/?m=994" title="Our page on Robert Jackson - 'the Member for Wantage (Mr. Jackson)'">Mr. Jackson</a> that there can never be total certainty on these matters, but if the Government are to safeguard <a href="/glossary/?gl=247" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_interest" class="glossary">the national interest</a> and people's lives, we need to be as certain as we can be of the hazards Britain faces, so that the correct action can be taken by our Government and their allies.</p> <p pid=".783.0/9">It is also vitally important that any future Government, before they discharge their most solemn duty&#8212;the dispatch of our forces abroad&#8212;must be able to convince the House and the British people of the necessity for action. I have little doubt that such a solemn duty will be required of a future Prime Minister and, given the fact that many of the threats we face from rogue states, weapons of mass destruction and terrorists are incubated in secrecy, we must have sound intelligence before we can make a convincing case for necessary action. The inquiry, for which we have long argued, is thus clearly in the nation's interest as a means of rebuilding public confidence and strengthening our capacity to defend ourselves and make the world a safer place. Those are serious issues, which the inquiry must address.</p> <p pid=".783.0/10">The inquiry may show that no one is to blame; after all, no one should underestimate the difficulties of obtaining accurate intelligence on countries such as Iraq. However, there must be lessons to be learned and it is essential that we learn them.</p>            </div>

Friend, as ever, makes his point to perfection.</p> <p pid=".785.7/2">I mentioned the consistency of the Conservative position on the inquiry. Although I am reluctant at this stage to introduce this small note of controversy, that is a contrast with the lack of consistency on the issue that we have seen from others. For many months, the <a href="/glossary/?gl=264" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prime_Minister_of_the_United_Ki ngdom" class="glossary">Prime Minister</a> has been in denial about the need for an inquiry. Indeed, it must be said that he was the last person to change his mind. When I asked him about it last week, he replied that we should wait for the Iraq survey group to complete its work, yet now he says that an inquiry is the right approach because the Iraq survey group probably will not report in the very near term. What did he discover between last Wednesday and yesterday that led him to that conclusion?</p> <p pid=".785.7/3">The Prime <a href="/glossary/?gl=35" title="Ministers make up the Government and almost all are members of the House of..." class="glossary">Minister</a> and the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foreign_Secretary">Foreign Secretary</a> say that it is now right to hold an inquiry because of what <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Kay">David Kay</a> said, but David Kay's remarks were the very comments that I put to the Prime Minister last week. What a pity no one told the <a href="/glossary/?gl=263" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lord_Chancellor" class="glossary">Lord Chancellor</a> and the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leader_of_the_House">Leader of the House</a> that the Prime Minister was changing his mind. Only this Sunday, the Leader of the House was still saying,</p> <p class="indent" pid=".785.7/4">"let's wait for the survey group to finish".</p> <p pid=".785.7/5">When the Lord <a href="/glossary/?gl=170" title="The Chancellor - also known as &quot;Chancellor of the Exchequer&quot; is responsible..." class="glossary">Chancellor</a> was asked&#8212;also on Sunday&#8212;whether there should now be an inquiry on weapons of mass destruction, he replied:</p> <p class="indent" pid=".785.7/6">"No, I don't think there should".</p> <p pid=".785.7/7">So what has happened? Why did the Government perform such an extraordinary volte-face in the space of two days?</p> <p pid=".785.7/8">I would really like to think that my renewed calls for an inquiry over the weekend may have had something to do with that decision, but in fact I am realistic and I know perfectly well that it had nothing to do with me. The thing that changed between Sunday, when an inquiry was apparently quite out of the question, and Monday, when it was not, was the statement from <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/President_Bush">President Bush</a>. It is the President who deserves all the credit&#8212;I am happy to give it to him&#8212;for changing the Prime Minister's mind on this issue. Where the President led, the Prime Minister followed, so we should all be grateful to the President. At least we have an inquiry, and as I say, I am grateful for that.</p>            </div>

I was not happy with the wording that the <a href="/glossary/?gl=264" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prime_Minister_of_the_United_Ki ngdom" class="glossary">Prime Minister</a> originally proposed to me. I wanted it to be clear that the committee can and should consider the way in which the Government used the intelligence with which they had been provided. That is now included fairly and squarely in the terms of reference that have been agreed. Indeed, that is why I agreed to them.</p> <p pid=".789.4/3">There are some things that can and should be done in relation to these issues, however, that do not need the report of that inquiry. Some things could be done now. Writing in <i>The Independent</i> today, Dr. <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brian_Jones">Brian Jones</a> has made a specific request to the Prime <a href="/glossary/?gl=35" title="Ministers make up the Government and almost all are members of the House of..." class="glossary">Minister</a> to publish now the intelligence which he was not shown at the time, but which he says lay behind the Government's key claims that Iraq was actively producing chemical weapons and could launch an attack within 45 minutes of an order to do so. <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Prime_Minister">The Prime Minister</a> has referred to that intelligence today in his speech. It clearly exists. Dr. Jones says that it should now be released. Given that Saddam Hussein has been overthrown, even if that intelligence came from a source that was sensitive when Saddam still ruled Iraq, Dr. Jones clearly believes that it is no longer sensitive now, although he went on to say that, if there is a reason of sensitivity, the Prime Minister should state it clearly. It seems to me that the request made by Dr. Jones is entirely reasonable. I hope the Prime Minister will respond to it. If he chooses not to, I hope that the <a href="/glossary/?gl=23" title="Secretary of State was originally the title given to the two officials who..." class="glossary">Secretary of State</a> for Defence will deal with it in his winding-up speech.</p>            </div>

                                  <div class="debate-speech__content">                <p pid=".789.6/1">I suggest that the hon. Gentleman read what Dr. Jones said in his article today. What Dr. Jones said is that he thinks that the intelligence should be published. He doubts whether there is any reason of sensitivity for not publishing it. <i>[Interruption.]</i> If the hon. Gentleman will wait just a moment, I shall carry on telling him what Dr. Jones said. Dr. Jones said that, if there is a reason of such sensitivity for not publishing the intelligence, the <a href="/glossary/?gl=264" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prime_Minister_of_the_United_Ki ngdom" class="glossary">Prime Minister</a> should say so clearly. Presumably, Dr. Jones would be happy with that, and so would I.</p> <p pid=".789.6/2">We must always remember that the <a href="/glossary/?gl=17" title="http://www.the-hutton-inquiry.org.uk/" class="glossary">Hutton inquiry</a> was first and foremost about a tragedy: the tragic loss of a gifted and honourable scientist. I join the Prime <a href="/glossary/?gl=35" title="Ministers make up the Government and almost all are members of the House of..." class="glossary">Minister</a> in paying tribute to the dignity with which Dr. Kelly's family have behaved during the months that have passed since his death. <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lord_Hutton">Lord Hutton</a> has completed his report. I accepted its conclusions last week. Lord Hutton sets out in some detail what happened regarding the events surrounding the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Kelly">David Kelly</a>'s death, but he provided no recommendations. So it is up to the House and the Government to consider the lessons of those tragic events. There are lessons about the use of intelligence, about the way in which <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Select_Committees">Select Committees</a> should operate in future, about treatment of staff, about the way in which the Government do their business and about the Government's relationship with the media.</p> <p pid=".789.6/3">In the use of intelligence, a new precedent has now been set through the publication of intelligence dossiers. Everyone is clear about the February dossier&#8212;the dodgy dossier, to which I have already referred. The process that led to the publication of that document must never happen again.</p> <p pid=".789.6/4">The September dossier was the first document, so far as I am aware, prepared by the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joint_Intelligence_Committee">Joint Intelligence Committee</a> and published by the Government. That decision gives rise to very serious questions. Will it be possible in future to go to war without publishing dossiers of that kind, including material from intelligence? If they are to be published, can the process of publication be better managed than it was on that occasion? For example, should not the Government have gone to greater lengths to avoid the kind of false interpretation that was placed on the 45 minutes claim? When, for example, newspapers published headlines such as "45 minutes from attack", on the day of the September dossier, and "Brits 45 minutes from doom", the day after, should not the Government have made it clear that the claim in the dossier referred to battlefield weapons? The <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intelligence_and_Security_Committee">Intelligence and Security Committee</a> said:</p> <p class="indent" pid=".789.6/5">"the context of the intelligence on the 45 minutes claim should have been explained, in particular the fact that it was assessed to refer to battlefield chemical and biological munitions and their movement on the battlefield, not to any other form of chemical or biological attack, should have been highlighted in the dossier. The omission of this context and assessment allowed speculation as to its exact meaning".</p> <p pid=".789.6/6">That was the finding of the Committee. The Government response failed to respond to that specific point, which was the point raised by my right hon. Friend <a href="/mp/?m=700" title="Our page on James Arbuthnot - 'the Member for North-East Hampshire (Mr. Arbuthnot)'">Mr. Arbuthnot</a> in his <a href="/glossary/?gl=39" title="An intervention is when the MP making a speech is interrupted by another MP..." class="glossary">intervention</a>. The <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Defence_Secretary">Defence Secretary</a> was asked at the Hutton inquiry,</p> <p class="indent" pid=".789.6/7">"why was no corrective statement issued for the benefit of the public in relation to those media reports?"</p> <p pid=".789.6/8">He replied, "I do not know". Perhaps the Prime Minister can provide an assurance that lessons from that episode have been learned.</p> <p pid=".789.6/9">There may also be lessons to be learned about how the operation of Select Committees can be improved. In the previous Parliament, my noble Friend Lord Norton of Louth chaired a commission of distinguished parliamentarians and constitutional experts, and proposed ways to strengthen democratic control of the Executive. Many of its recommendations relate to Select Committees, including strengthening their research support. Our party's pledge at the last election was to make sure that Select Committees are independent of party managers, which also followed the work of the Norton commission.</p> <p pid=".789.6/10">Then there is the Government. There are specific criticisms of the Ministry of Defence in the <a href="/glossary/?gl=7" title="http://www.the-hutton-inquiry.org.uk/content/report/" class="glossary">Hutton report</a>, focusing on the way in which it treated Dr. Kelly in relation to the naming process. Paragraph 432 of the report states:</p> <p class="indent" pid=".789.6/11">"The principal fault lay in the failure of the MoD to inform <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dr_Kelly">Dr Kelly</a> that the press office was going to confirm his name if a journalist suggested it."</p> <p pid=".789.6/12">I trust that across Government attention will be paid in future to ensuring that their employees are given the care and respect that they deserve.</p>            </div>

                                  <div class="debate-speech__content">                <p pid=".791.3/1">That is an interesting and important question. I was a member of the Government who set up the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intelligence_and_Security_Committee">Intelligence and Security Committee</a>, and who did so on the basis on which it currently exists. I do not want to rush into any judgment on the important question raised by the hon. Lady: it is an important question that has many implications, but it requires mature consideration.</p> <p pid=".791.3/2">There are also lessons in the <a href="/glossary/?gl=7" title="http://www.the-hutton-inquiry.org.uk/content/report/" class="glossary">Hutton report</a> about the process of government. There is a lack of documentary evidence of the conclusions of crucial meetings, on which <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lord_Hutton">Lord Hutton</a> commented in the course of the inquiry. Two weeks ago, the House debated the issue of a civil service Act. Once again, the Government said that they were in favour of such an Act in principle. Once again, they failed to give any indication that they were about to turn that theory into practice. They need to do so. The independence and impartiality of the civil service need to be given statutory reinforcement.</p> <p pid=".791.3/3">The most serious and far-reaching repercussions of the Hutton report in the last week have been for the BBC. I want to start by paying tribute to <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gavyn_Davies">Gavyn Davies</a> and <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greg_Dyke">Greg Dyke</a>. Notwithstanding the criticisms contained in the Hutton report, to which I will refer in a minute, they both made a very significant contribution to the BBC. Clearly, however, the BBC did make mistakes in the handling of this issue. Indeed, Gavyn Davies and Greg Dyke have acknowledged as much themselves. I believe that some institutional changes are required, too. <a href="/glossary/?gl=85" title="The Conservatives are a centre-right political party in the UK, founded in..." class="glossary">Conservatives</a> have long argued that the governors cannot properly both run and regulate the BBC and that, particularly in relation to complaints procedures, there should be a role for <a href="/glossary/?gl=217" title="Ofcom is the independent regulator and competition authority for the UK..." class="glossary">Ofcom</a>. Ofcom already has some jurisdiction over the BBC, so it is difficult to see how there can be any objection in principle to extending its remit in this way. At the last election, we specifically argued that Ofcom should have jurisdiction over complaints. If that had been in place, the most important of the complaints made by the Government would have been dealt with by Ofcom. That might have had a significant effect on the whole tragic train of events that led to the death of <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Kelly">David Kelly</a>.</p> <p pid=".791.3/4">When all is said and done, however, the Hutton report must not be used to undermine the independence of the BBC. On this issue, many people have concerns about the Government's reaction. Within minutes of the Hutton report, <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alastair_Campbell">Alastair Campbell</a> was touring the studios demanding multiple resignations. Officials made it clear that the <a href="/glossary/?gl=264" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prime_Minister_of_the_United_Ki ngdom" class="glossary">Prime Minister</a> was not satisfied with the resignation of Gavyn Davies. Even after Greg Dyke's initial apology, the Prime <a href="/glossary/?gl=35" title="Ministers make up the Government and almost all are members of the House of..." class="glossary">Minister</a>'s official spokesman said that the BBC response was not good enough. Then, after seeing the reaction of the public, the Prime Minister said that all he ever wanted was an apology.</p> <p pid=".791.3/5">There is an essential point of principle here. No one should underestimate the vital role that a free media plays in sustaining a vigorous and healthy democracy.</p>            </div>

That includes challenging politicians. Sometimes, however occasionally, that process of holding us all to account can include making allegations about integrity. When that is appropriate, the media should not feel intimidated into not doing so. It is rather ironic that those who are now screaming for such challenges to become out of bounds were in the forefront of making them until they assumed office.</p>            </div>

In doing so, I quoted&#8212;verbatim, I think&#8212;from something that had been said on that very day by someone else in an article in <i>The Independent on Sunday</i>. That someone else&#8212;<i>[Interruption.]</i> I think that hon. Members should listen for a moment. That someone else was <a href="/mp/?m=1021" title="Our page on Peter Kilfoyle - 'the hon.

In that article, describing the Government's spin, he said:</p> <p class="indent" pid=".793.4/2">"This is spin of a different order to the kind which was around for many years. That sort of spin was an attempt to put the best gloss on government policy and action. It was not a consistent and concerted effort at evasiveness and duplicity which has become the hallmark of government in the perception of so many."</p> <p pid=".793.4/3">On that day, I associated myself with the words of the hon.

If he had answered them immediately and straightforwardly, there would have been no difficulty at all. I must say to the hon. Gentleman that if he were to look back at the answers that the Prime <a href="/glossary/?gl=35" title="Ministers make up the Government and almost all are members of the House of..." class="glossary">Minister</a> gave to those questions, he would regret his accusation of "loyally wriggling".

The <a href="/glossary/?gl=7" title="http://www.the-hutton-inquiry.org.uk/content/report/" class="glossary">Hutton report</a> has been subjected to intense comment, some of it questioning, some of it critical, and some of it more than a little incredulous. Unfortunately for the <a href="/glossary/?gl=264" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prime_Minister_of_the_United_Ki ngdom" class="glossary">Prime Minister</a>, the initial opinion of his colleagues last Wednesday does not seem to be reflected in the more settled opinion of the public. In the past, people would sometimes warn me of the dangers of winning an argument in this House, but not in the country. In a spirit of good will, perhaps I can offer the Prime <a href="/glossary/?gl=35" title="Ministers make up the Government and almost all are members of the House of..." class="glossary">Minister</a> that same piece of advice.</p> <p pid=".794.8/3">There are clearly very important lessons to be learned from the Hutton report about how Governments of different parties run their business. There are lessons that the Prime Minister needs to address and lessons that leaders of any party need to address. That is why I have dealt with some of the general questions arising from the report and how they might be addressed in the absence of recommendations from <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lord_Hutton">Lord Hutton</a>; why I welcome the fact that the Prime Minister has accepted the need for a wider inquiry on the relation between intelligence and Government; and why it is essential that Governments of all political persuasions are extremely sensitive to the independence of the media, particularly the BBC, in the way in which they conduct themselves.</p> <p pid=".794.8/4">These are not easy decisions for any Government, and they require a great deal of restraint. I do not pretend that that was always present when my party was in power, and it is clear from the Hutton report that it has not been present in recent times. There are lessons to be learned from the events that led to the <a href="/glossary/?gl=17" title="http://www.the-hutton-inquiry.org.uk/" class="glossary">Hutton inquiry</a>, and I hope that they will be learned.</p>            </div>

Whatever our disagreements and differences, whether this week or during the war, on the issues and principles at stake, once the <a href="/glossary/?gl=17" title="http://www.the-hutton-inquiry.org.uk/" class="glossary">Hutton inquiry</a> was established, we did not, as the Prime <a href="/glossary/?gl=35" title="Ministers make up the Government and almost all are members of the House of..." class="glossary">Minister</a> was reasonable enough to acknowledge to me publicly across the Floor of the House last week, seek at any point to impugn his integrity or to reach premature judgments on the report. That distinction has not been lost on people inside and outside the House.</p> <p pid=".795.0/2">We accept the fundamental conclusion reached in the report&#8212;namely, that the Government did not insert intelligence information that they knew to be wrong into the dossier. There is no doubt whatsoever that mistakes were made by the BBC. There used to be an old saying at the BBC that whenever there was an inquiry, deputy heads would roll. This occasion has been the exception to the rule, because although two senior heads have rolled, as well as the junior head&#8212;Gilligan&#8212;deputy heads of management have remained unscathed. Some of us looking at the BBC from the outside in find that a bit puzzling, given the management shortcomings that the report clearly reveals.</p> <p pid=".795.0/3">I make this plea regarding the BBC. Last week, a number of hon. Members on both sides of the Chamber said that the report would become a weapon with which to beat the BBC and to undermine its integrity and independence in relation to function and funding. Now that the licence renewal process is under way and the charter is up for discussion, I hope, given the pledge that the Prime Minister made last week in his response to the resignations that took place, that the Government will ensure that the BBC's independence and integrity remain inviolate. Whatever mistakes were made in this case&#8212;and they were serious mistakes that led to serious consequences for all those involved and contributed to the particularly tragic consequence on which the report is centred&#8212;it is in all our long-term interests to have a viable, questioning, independent BBC. That is important not only for our national public life in Britain, but for the reputation of our country around the world.</p> <p pid=".795.0/4">It is clear that, as the Government and the Prime Minister have acknowledged, significant criticisms are made in the Hutton report. As the Prime Minister knows, our reservations about Hutton are based on similar grounds to those of the reservations that we expressed in our conversations earlier this week with regard to the next inquiry that is now coming on stream. The concern is that the tightness of the remit does not adequately enable the inquiries to address the fundamental question that the public want addressed&#8212;the political judgments that were taken at the top of the Government in committing this country to war.</p>            </div>

That is not to forgive or overlook the fact that Dr. Kelly had overstepped his remit in terms of his governmental position. None the less, given the seniority and quality of the input that he had provided for the interests of this country over so many decades, it seems that the criticisms are very telling. First, there was the grotesquely bizarre strategy that was arrived at to somehow get out Dr. Kelly's name under "<a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Any_Questions">Any Questions</a>?" style inquiries through the press officers in the Government. Secondly, given the torrent of interest that was going to descend upon his head, he was not given adequate press support or indeed private security when that strategy erupted and he found himself in the public domain. It is important that that issue be borne in mind.</p> <p pid=".798.3/3">On the dossier itself, as the <a href="/glossary/?gl=264" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prime_Minister_of_the_United_Ki ngdom" class="glossary">Prime Minister</a> said, the whole matter of public presentation is significant, not least in terms of the vital 45-minute issue. Yesterday, the Government said in paragraph 15 of their response to the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intelligence_and_Security_Committee">Intelligence and Security Committee</a>:</p> <p class="indent" pid=".798.3/4">"The Government understands the reasoning behind the Committee's view (paragraph 112) that the presentation of the 45 minutes issue in the dossier, which was compiled for the public and not for experienced readers of intelligence material, allowed speculation as to its exact meaning."</p> <p pid=".798.3/5">When the Prime <a href="/glossary/?gl=35" title="Ministers make up the Government and almost all are members of the House of..." class="glossary">Minister</a> says, "I am not responsible for headlines in the London <i>Standard</i> or anywhere else", it is worth bearing in mind the colossal public build-up and the sense of anticipation that surrounded the document. In the huge public relations activity that the Government entered into, they made every conceivable effort on public presentation in terms of the interpretation of the document&#8212;presentation that was clearly designed decisively to move people in one direction, and one direction only. However, as the Prime Minister acknowledged some time ago in the House, they did not do a very good job, as public opinion remained largely unmoved.</p>            </div>

                                  <div class="debate-speech__content">                <p pid=".800.1/1">The opening speeches have been quite wide ranging. For reasons that I trust my colleagues will understand, I wish to concentrate on some specific aspects that are covered in the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intelligence_and_Security_Committee">Intelligence and Security Committee</a>'s Report, "Iraqi Weapons of <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mass_Destruction">Mass Destruction</a>&#8212;Intelligence and Assessments", which is helpfully described in the <a href="/glossary/?gl=5" title="The order paper is issued daily and lists the business which will be dealt..." class="glossary">Order Paper</a> as relevant to the debate.</p> <p pid=".800.1/2">I say at the beginning that in respect of Dr. <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Kelly">David Kelly</a>, from whom the Intelligence and Security Committee took evidence the day before his death, I agree with <a href="/mp/?m=820" title="Our page on Patrick Cormack - 'the hon. Member for South Staffordshire (Sir Patrick Cormack)'">Sir Patrick Cormack</a>, who said last week that his death was a great personal tragedy but not a great public scandal. I think that that is the right way of putting it. As someone who gave evidence to the <a href="/glossary/?gl=17" title="http://www.the-hutton-inquiry.org.uk/" class="glossary">Hutton inquiry</a>, and followed it carefully, I stand by what I said at the beginning of the inquiry, which was that we must all accept it and accept the totality of the outcome in all respects.</p> <p pid=".800.1/3">I shall take the House back to a time a little before the Hutton inquiry. In the annual report of the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISC">ISC</a>, which we wrote in May 2003, we said:</p> <p class="indent" pid=".800.1/4">"It is impossible at the present moment to make any definitive statements about the role of intelligence in the situation in Iraq. . . . We intend to examine in more detail the intelligence and assessments available and their use."</p> <p pid=".800.1/5"><a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/In_July">In July</a> last year the House voted for the following motion:</p> <p class="indent" pid=".800.1/6">"That . . . the Intelligence and Security Committee, established by Parliament, by statute, is the appropriate body to consider intelligence relating to Iraq; and notes that it has already begun its work."</p> <p pid=".800.1/7">During last summer, the ISC worked incredibly hard to deliver the report that we produced to my right hon. Friend the <a href="/glossary/?gl=264" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prime_Minister_of_the_United_Ki ngdom" class="glossary">Prime Minister</a> on <phrase class="date" code="2004-09-09">9 September</phrase>. It was published in full, despite speculation to the contrary, by my right hon. Friend. I pay tribute to the members of that Committee. Much of that work was done during the summer recess, and most of our meetings are attended in full by all of the members. I thank our staff, who worked extremely hard, and the agencies that provided the information that we requested.</p> <p pid=".800.1/8">The ISC produced a unanimous report, even though we are a multi-party Committee with members who took very different views on the war: we are a Committee of nine members, five of whom voted for action against Iraq. However, our conclusions are unanimous, and I hope that they are all the stronger for that. I am obviously pleased that <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lord_Hutton">Lord Hutton</a>, who covered some of the same areas, agreed with many of our conclusions and quoted them.</p> <p pid=".800.1/9">Yesterday, the Government published their response to the Committee's report. In that response they chose, as has been mentioned, to highlight some of our conclusions&#8212;only some. Nevertheless, they are valid. We said that the September dossier was endorsed by the whole <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JIC">JIC</a>. The September document was founded on the intelligence assessments then available. It was not sexed up. Perhaps most important of all, the JIC was not subject to political pressures. Its independence and impartiality were not compromised in any way.</p> <p pid=".800.1/10">I know that those issues are not central in the minds of many people now because the arguments have moved on, but at the time they were the original charges that were put to the Government. They have now been rejected not only by Lord Hutton and not only by the ISC but by the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foreign_Affairs_Committee">Foreign Affairs Committee</a>.</p> <p pid=".800.1/11">I turn to some sections of the Committee's report that make significant points that the Government have not highlighted because they do not always agree with them. First, we believe and we say that there was a casual attitude to the 45-minute issue. We are not blaming Ministers; we are not criticising Ministers. Instead we are saying that the issue was badly handled by intelligence professionals, not least because they were not thinking of the audience who would be reading the document. Similarly, there is the issue of battlefield weapons.</p> <p pid=".800.1/12">We made significant comments that the Government have partly taken on board about reporting differences of opinion to the JIC within different agencies, Departments or organisations. This is specific to <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brian_Jones">Brian Jones</a>. It is a question of principle how differing views within any organisation or service can be fed to the JIC chairman when necessary.</p> <p pid=".800.1/13">There is much more that I would like to say about the problems of terminology and about issues that were left out of the dossier that could have been in to help people understand the nature of weapons of mass destruction and that terminology and wording. In the Prime <a href="/glossary/?gl=35" title="Ministers make up the Government and almost all are members of the House of..." class="glossary">Minister</a>'s original draft of his introduction there was reference to the fact that he was not talking about an attack on London. There was not time to go into all of those details. However, one important point relates to the basic problem of the JIC assessment on which the September dossier was based. It is covered in paragraphs 64 to 67 of our report. The JIC minute of the meeting of <phrase class="date" code="2002-09-04">4 September 2002</phrase> stated that the then draft of what became the JIC's assessment of <phrase class="date" code="2004-09-09">9 September</phrase></p> <p class="indent" pid=".800.1/14">"needed to make clearer which of its judgments were based on firm intelligence, which were based more on informed assessment or interpretation, and where the major intelligence gaps in the UK's knowledge and understanding of Iraq's capabilities remained."</p> <p pid=".800.1/15">The ISC believes that the final JIC assessment issued before the September dossier was a balanced assessment of the scenario. However, I quote the ISC's report and its verdict on the JIC's assessment:</p> <p class="indent" pid=".800.1/16">"it did not highlight the key judgements, the uncertainties and the gaps in the UK's knowledge about the Iraqi biological and chemical weapons."</p> <p pid=".800.1/17">That meant that the JIC assessment, which was written for Ministers, did not highlight those, and consequently they were not highlighted in the dossier. We believe that that omission is the cause of much of the discussion and many of the difficulties that have arisen about the dossier.</p> <p pid=".800.1/18">There is much more that I would like to say. I want to mention the continuing work of the ISC and, in particular, the work that we have flagged up in our report on the agencies' relationship with the media, which is a very important area that we want to look at.</p> <p pid=".800.1/19">I wish that this debate were longer, but I hope that those who were making accusations against the Government about the September dossier will acknowledge the weight of the evidence presented by Lord Hutton and the ISC.</p>            </div>

Member for Dewsbury (Ann Taylor)'">Ann Taylor</a>, the Chairman of the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intelligence_and_Security_Committee">Intelligence and Security Committee</a>, who rightly said that it is a great pity that the debate is not going on longer. Many of us called, first, for the debate to continue until 10 o'clock, or, secondly, for it to be a two-day debate. The <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leader_of_the_House">Leader of the House</a> ignored us, but I believe that today we are fully vindicated. I am very pleased that the right hon. Lady, an ex-Government <a href="/glossary/?gl=8" title="The government chief whip, whose official title is parliamentary secretary..." class="glossary">Chief Whip</a> and Chairman of the appropriate Committee, entirely agrees; her point was well made.</p> <p pid=".802.0/2">My first point, which I put to the <a href="/glossary/?gl=23" title="Secretary of State was originally the title given to the two officials who..." class="glossary">Secretary of State</a> for Defence&#8212;I should have liked to put it also to the <a href="/glossary/?gl=264" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prime_Minister_of_the_United_Ki ngdom" class="glossary">Prime Minister</a>&#8212;is that sometimes there are wrongs that are so serious that an apology is not sufficient, and a resignation or sacking is required. I refer specifically to what <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lord_Hutton">Lord Hutton</a> said in paragraph 463 of his report, when he said that it was "wholly improper" for Mr. <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tom_Kelly">Tom Kelly</a> to have said before the funeral that Dr. <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Kelly">David Kelly</a>, who had only just died, was a <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Walter_Mitty">Walter Mitty</a> figure. I need hardly say to the Secretary of State that that not only caused great hurt to Dr. Kelly's family and friends but was patently untrue, as was shown by all the tributes made to Dr. Kelly, perhaps most powerfully by the Prime <a href="/glossary/?gl=35" title="Ministers make up the Government and almost all are members of the House of..." class="glossary">Minister</a> himself. I cannot understand how the Prime Minister can allow Mr. Tom Kelly to remain one of his most senior advisers in Downing street and to deal with the press.</p>            </div>

                                  <div class="debate-speech__content">                <p pid=".804.2/1">Thank you, Mr. <a href="/glossary/?gl=6" title="The Deputy speaker is in charge of proceedings of the House of Commons in..." class="glossary">Deputy Speaker</a>, for calling me to speak in this important debate. I do so as a member of the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intelligence_and_Security_Committee">Intelligence and Security Committee</a>, but also as someone who did not support the Government in going to war in Iraq, and who would maintain that view today. However, let me say at the outset that my difficulty in supporting the Government at that time was not because I felt that they had behaved improperly over intelligence matters or exercised improper influence over the intelligence agencies, but because I disagreed with the political judgments that they took after receiving the intelligence, and because of other issues, not intelligence-related, which were part of the open and public political debate at the time.</p> <p pid=".804.2/2">I support what my right hon. Friend <a href="/mp/?m=1269" title="Our page on Ann Taylor - 'the Member for Dewsbury (Ann Taylor)'">Ann Taylor</a> said about the Intelligence and Security Committee. She rightly refuted the claim that members of the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISC">ISC</a>, because they are appointed by the <a href="/glossary/?gl=264" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prime_Minister_of_the_United_Ki ngdom" class="glossary">Prime Minister</a>, are there to do the Prime <a href="/glossary/?gl=35" title="Ministers make up the Government and almost all are members of the House of..." class="glossary">Minister</a>'s bidding. The fact that he appoints us is in any case, in my view, far more significant in theory than in practice, as in practice consultations take place between the parties and the Whips, and, furthermore, I believe that we take our duties as parliamentarians seriously and reject the idea that the job of a Committee member is to be a cipher for anyone, the Prime Minister included.</p> <p pid=".804.2/3">The ISC report contained criticisms of the Government, as well as recognising areas where they should definitely not be blamed. <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Committee">The Committee</a> was able to agree the report unanimously, on the basis of the detailed investigations that it carried out, but the point needs to be stressed that intelligence, and the conclusions drawn from it, are only one part of the overall situation, forming only a part of the basis on which a political judgment on whether to go to war is made.</p> <p pid=".804.2/4">The other elements are familiar to all of us, yet, frustratingly, in all the furore over intelligence, get overlooked. Those include issues such as whether it was advisable to give the inspectors more time, given that they had begun to have successes, and issues such as achieving a wider and bigger coalition of countries willing to take action, or whether the importance of our alliance with the United States should take precedence, to which the Prime Minister and the Government obviously attached great priority.</p> <p pid=".804.2/5">Other issues include whether the United Nations should have had a wider and more direct role, and questions about the international legality of the proposed action. In my view, many of those wider issues militated against the Government going to war when they did, but other wider issues motivated people to take a different view&#8212;in particular, the flouting by Iraq over many years of United Nations resolutions, and its appalling treatment of its own citizens. One of the issues that made me hesitate at the time of the vote was the powerful testimony from my hon. Friend <a href="/mp/?m=807" title="Our page on Ann Clwyd - 'the Member for Cynon Valley (Ann Clwyd)'">Ann Clwyd</a>, and the testimonies that she ensured were heard of the families of Saddam Hussein's victims.</p> <p pid=".804.2/6">To say that the decision to go to war was completely intelligence-driven is inaccurate, and I regret the fact that Ministers sometimes give that impression. To blame intelligence for the decision to go to war is entirely unwarranted.</p> <p pid=".804.2/7">Let me turn to the report of <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lord_Hutton">Lord Hutton</a> and its aftermath. When Lord Hutton was appointed, the press were full of praise for his integrity and the respect in which he was held by colleagues throughout the judiciary and more widely. I do not believe that he has undergone a personality or character change in the past few months, so I find it depressing that he is now being portrayed in some sections of the press as a biased and even dishonourable Government stooge. After the initial stunned reaction by the press to the report, we have seen a media fightback over the weekend, seemingly fuelled by disappointed rage that the report did not lambast the Government, as had been so fervently hoped.</p> <p pid=".804.2/8">Some of the media coverage has been, frankly, vicious and shocking. I could give many examples, but to give just one, <i><a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Sunday_Times">The Sunday Times</a></i> ran the screaming headline "Campbell crows", continuing on the next page, "as widow grieves". That seems to me to be a completely unacceptable way of reporting anything. It is offensive both to <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alastair_Campbell">Alastair Campbell</a>, who was exonerated in the <a href="/glossary/?gl=7" title="http://www.the-hutton-inquiry.org.uk/content/report/" class="glossary">Hutton report</a>, and to Dr. Kelly's widow and family, on whom it piles further distress and intrusion.</p>            </div>

I am referring only to some of the disgraceful headlines in the press, which do not do their writers any credit.</p> <p pid=".806.0/2">A number of surveys have concluded that people do not believe the findings of the <a href="/glossary/?gl=7" title="http://www.the-hutton-inquiry.org.uk/content/report/" class="glossary">Hutton report</a>, but I believe that it is dishonest and unacceptable to conduct instant surveys, when the respondents are unlikely even to have seen a copy of the report, and would not have had time to read it. Indeed, how many of us can claim to have read and fully digested every word? Conducting surveys in such circumstances is another vivid example of how superficial and wild the response to the report has been.</p> <p pid=".806.0/3">Like other hon. Members, I strongly defend a free press and believe in fearless investigative journalism, but such journalism should be accurate, and not based on unchecked and unsubstantiated information. On the BBC, I regret the fact that <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gavyn_Davies">Gavyn Davies</a> and <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greg_Dyke">Greg Dyke</a> resigned, and I am far less interested in resignations than in efforts to improve the accuracy of reporting. Improved journalistic standards, rather than finding scapegoats, would be the ideal consequence of the Hutton report.</p> <p pid=".806.0/4">On the new inquiry that the Government announced yesterday, I was pleased that my right hon. Friends the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foreign_Secretary">Foreign Secretary</a> and the <a href="/glossary/?gl=264" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prime_Minister_of_the_United_Ki ngdom" class="glossary">Prime Minister</a> said that their preference would have been for the all-party <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intelligence_and_Security_Committee">Intelligence and Security Committee</a> to undertake further work. I regret strongly the fact that neither the Conservative party nor the Liberal Democrats have sufficient faith in their own parliamentary colleagues, and that the <a href="/glossary/?gl=85" title="The Conservatives are a centre-right political party in the UK, founded in..." class="glossary">Conservatives</a> in particular pressed for a committee that is already being perceived in the press as more pro-establishment in its composition than a cross-party Committee of parliamentarians.</p> <p pid=".806.0/5">I am also not convinced that we needed to follow the example of the inquiry announced by <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/President_Bush">President Bush</a>. The situation in the United States is different, and in particular, unlike the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISC">ISC</a>, the US congressional intelligence committees have failed to achieve a common view and have split on party lines. Indeed, electoral considerations have played a huge and unhelpful part in the deliberations in the United States.</p> <p pid=".806.0/6">The committee that we have set up will have some real issues to consider, arising both from earlier reports and from the findings of the Iraq survey group. I wish it well, but, whatever its findings, it cannot change the reality that the decision to go to war was based on a political judgment&#8212;openly debated, and about which there will always be controversy&#8212;just as the decision to take military action on numerous other occasions has been.</p>            </div>

                                  <div class="debate-speech__content">                <p pid=".807.1/1">The hon. Gentleman wants me to say that Mr. Gilligan's allegations were not proved, which I accept, but it is incumbent on the hon. Gentleman to accept that there is an issue. A new situation arose with the publication of the dossier. Never before has a decision of such importance been based on published evidence from the security services. The relationship between politicians and the intelligence services will form an important part of the inquiry that has just been established and must fall within its remit.</p> <p pid=".807.1/2">I attended some of the evidence sessions of the <a href="/glossary/?gl=17" title="http://www.the-hutton-inquiry.org.uk/" class="glossary">Hutton inquiry</a>. I watched <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Scarlett">John Scarlett</a> give his presentation and suffer cross-examination by Mr. Dingemans and <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lord_Hutton">Lord Hutton</a>. I have no reason to question John Scarlett's integrity or ability, but it was clear to me from the evidence that he presented and the evidence with which he was confronted that at the time when the dossier was produced he was under intense pressure and subject to many competing claims on his attention and judgment, and I shall give two examples of that.</p> <p pid=".807.1/3">First, there were competing memorandums&#8212;some from <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alastair_Campbell">Alastair Campbell</a> and some from the defence intelligence services. Some of them said "take out 'maybe' and put 'certainly'"; others said "take out 'certainly' and put 'maybe'". The idea that the defence intelligence services were giving substantive advice about the content of the document but Alastair Campbell was simply helping to present the information is a distinction that became blurred. It cannot possibly be said that under those circumstances it was easy for John Scarlett to make the judgment that he had to make. That is why the matter must be studied by the inquiry.</p> <p pid=".807.1/4">Secondly, I shall go further and give the House completely new information. Two weeks before the dossier was published, the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Institute_for_Strategic_Studies">International Institute for Strategic Studies</a> produced a dossier about Saddam Hussein's weapons of mass destruction. As <a href="/glossary/?gl=137" title="The shadow cabinet is the name given to the group of senior members from..." class="glossary">shadow</a> <a href="/glossary/?gl=23" title="Secretary of State was originally the title given to the two officials who..." class="glossary">Secretary of State</a> for Defence, I attended a private briefing with the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IISS">IISS</a> at which I learned that it had been summoned to No. 10 to give a presentation about its document. It had been told that there was concern that its document had stolen the thunder from the forthcoming publication of the Government document.</p> <p pid=".807.1/5">The evidence presented to the Hutton inquiry included information on the frantic search for any new information. The <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joint_Intelligence_Committee">Joint Intelligence Committee</a> was being put under pressure to come up with something new and sensational&#8212;my hon. Friend <a href="/mp/?m=740" title="Our page on Crispin Blunt - 'the Member for Reigate (Mr. Blunt)'">Mr. Blunt</a> referred to the headline that Alastair Campbell wanted so badly to make the case for war. The relationship and procedures between the intelligence services and politicians must be reviewed by the inquiry. I am pleased to say that the inquiry undoubtedly covers that relationship because my right hon. and learned Friend the <a href="/glossary/?gl=175" title="The &quot;Leader of the Opposition&quot; is head of &quot;Her Majesty's Official..." class="glossary">Leader of the Opposition</a> has amended its terms of reference to include discrepancies between the intelligence gathered, evaluated and used by the Government before the conflict.</p> <p pid=".807.1/6">I pay tribute to the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secretary_of_State_for_Defence">Secretary of State for Defence</a>, who has been through a difficult time and must have had some sleepless nights questioning whether he did everything right under the circumstances. I am pleased that he has been acquitted by the Hutton inquiry of any wrongdoing. That is a good thing for politics and a good thing for politicians in general. In turn, I hope that he will have the generosity to acknowledge that public confidence in the relationship between politicians and the intelligence services is a real issue. If we want the public to believe that published intelligence information is intelligence and not propaganda, we must be able to answer the question, "At what stage does intelligence become propaganda when it is in the hands of the spin doctors and politicians?"</p>            </div>

I'm sorry for any of the stress that, albeit unintentionally, I may have caused him during his questioning before the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foreign_Affairs_Select_Committee">Foreign Affairs Select Committee</a>. I wish to express my sincere condolences to his wife and family."</p> <p pid=".808.0/3">Immediately after Dr. Kelly's death, a Sunday paper reprinted that statement and added, "And then Mackinlay went into hiding". I did not go into hiding, but I did not want to talk to the Sunday papers because I took the view, which was manifestly obvious out of courtesy and common sense, "The less said the better, let <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lord_Hutton">Lord Hutton</a> fulfil and discharge his duties, and let us have regard to a grieving family." On the Saturday when we learned about Dr. Kelly's death, my wife and I were appalled that a Sunday paper approached us to offer me money to comment. We have kept our counsel about that, but it was the case. I want to place on record how disgusted I was by that approach.</p> <p pid=".808.0/4">What was the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foreign_Affairs_Committee">Foreign Affairs Committee</a> doing last summer? We were trying to discharge our duty to Parliament to examine whether the Government exaggerated the case that they presented to Parliament and the people for going to war. We tried to discharge that duty as best we could, but our report to House states that we felt that we were frustrated in fulfilling that duty&#8212;that is not only my view, but that of the Committee.</p> <p pid=".808.0/5">I hope that the <a href="/glossary/?gl=264" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prime_Minister_of_the_United_Ki ngdom" class="glossary">Prime Minister</a> will reflect on the point that Lord Hutton cross-examined <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Scarlett">John Scarlett</a> in public, but the Foreign Affairs Committee was refused access to him. When we requested the drafts of the September dossier, we were refused them; Lord Hutton has put them on the worldwide web. If the Prime <a href="/glossary/?gl=35" title="Ministers make up the Government and almost all are members of the House of..." class="glossary">Minister</a> had said, "You can have John Scarlett in secret," we would have compromised. If he had said, "The documents will be written on rice paper and you must eat them afterwards," we would have compromised, too. There is a lesson about the capacity of the Government to respond to reasonable requests from parliamentary Committees, and I hope that that will be picked up as a serious point, despite the levity with which I introduced it.</p> <p pid=".808.0/6">There is an obsession with secrecy in this country. One thing that irritates me&#8212;the Committee chaired by my right hon. Friend <a href="/mp/?m=1269" title="Our page on Ann Taylor - 'the Member for Dewsbury (Ann Taylor)'">Ann Taylor</a> touched on this&#8212;is the interface between journalists and the security and intelligence services. In submission to Lord Hutton, I said that the security and intelligence services speak to journalists all the time. The people they will not speak to are politicians. That situation is surely unacceptable. I do not mind the security and intelligence services speaking to journalists, but I expect them to have a public interface with politicians, and particularly with Committees of this House.</p> <p pid=".808.0/7">I shall illustrate the point about the obsession with secrecy. On <phrase class="date" code="2004-07-17">17 July</phrase>, I asked the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foreign_Secretary">Foreign Secretary</a> this question:</p> <p class="indent" pid=".808.0/8">"when the head of <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MI6">MI6</a> met Mr. <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Humphrys">John Humphrys</a> of the BBC since <phrase class="date" code="2004-05-01">1 May</phrase> . . . and for what purpose each meeting was held".&#8212;[<a href="/search/?pop=1&s=date:20030717+column:586+section:wrans"><i>Hansard</i>, 17 July 2003; Vol. 409, c. 586W</a>.]</p> <p pid=".808.0/9">The answer was the equivalent of saying, "I'm not going to tell you; it's a secret." That is not sustainable and we cannot tolerate it. Is it really a matter of national security whether any such meeting took place?

Friend the <a href="/glossary/?gl=23" title="Secretary of State was originally the title given to the two officials who..." class="glossary">Secretary of State</a> for Defence winds up, perhaps he can tell us the latest position of the investigation into the fact that <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andrew_Gilligan">Andrew Gilligan</a> told the Foreign Affairs Committee that he had had access to a top-secret document. I told Lord Hutton that the source would not be discovered, because it was obviously from someone in a high echelon, so the Government dare not find out who it was. I repeat the point that people in the security and intelligence community talk to journalists all the time. If it was someone at the level of <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sarah_Tisdall">Sarah Tisdall</a>, he or she would be found out in five minutes, but people at the top are not discovered, and I really do not like that.</p> <p pid=".808.0/11">With the greatest respect to my good colleagues on the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intelligence_and_Security_Committee">Intelligence and Security Committee</a>, including my right hon.

I do not accept that it is a distinction without a difference that the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISC">ISC</a> is appointed by the Prime Minister, meets in secret and reports to him. The evidence given by Dr. <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Kay">David Kay</a> last week to the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/US_Congress">US Congress</a> would have been given in secret in this country.

Friend <a href="/mp/?m=1261" title="Our page on Gisela Stuart - 'the Member for Birmingham, Edgbaston (Ms Stuart)'">Ms Stuart</a> that the ISC's status must be reviewed. However, that review must be genuine, and not just a matter of passing a resolution that says that it is now a parliamentary Committee. As inadequate as our selection processes are, it should be for this Parliament to choose the Chairman and membership of the Committee that provides parliamentary oversight.</p> <p pid=".808.0/13">The <a href="/glossary/?gl=175" title="The &quot;Leader of the Opposition&quot; is head of &quot;Her Majesty's Official..." class="glossary">Leader of the Opposition</a> made an interesting speech. As he said, we must all reflect on what lessons are to be learned, and I shall do so. I know that the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liaison_Committee">Liaison Committee</a> and others are considering this issue, but witnesses who appear before our Committees need to be cautioned about our expectations. It is reasonable for us to expect candour and full disclosure. Witnesses should not be leaned on by other parties outside the hearings. We pass a motion to that effect in the Sessional Orders after every Queen's Speech. I appeal to Members who will review those orders not to do away with them, but to reinforce them and to see that they are brought to the attention of witnesses before they appear before Committees. That is in the interests of the witnesses and of fairness, because there appears to be a prevailing culture that it is legitimate to give away as little information to parliamentary Committees as one can get away with. I have seen that attitude in several Committees, from private and public sector witnesses, as well as Ministers. That has to be stopped; otherwise we will diminish our capacity to scrutinise, rather than expand it.</p> <p pid=".808.0/14">Every Select Committee has the chance to decide the subject of its inquiries. The danger is that Committees will be tempted to take the soft options, instead of adopting the issues that challenge the Government, and to which Governments find it difficult to respond. It is our duty not to buckle under pressure. We want <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Members_of_Parliament">Members of Parliament</a> who are prepared to ignore signs that say "No Trespassers" or "Do Not Enter". We should enter doors marked with such signs, and I give my commitment to the House that I shall do so&#8212;regardless of what has happened in the past, which I deeply regret. Otherwise, failing that, Parliament will be diminished.</p>            </div>

Political judgment is intertwined with decisions being made about intelligence, which is why I believe there is still a no man's land. I hope that the inquiry will trespass into that no man's land, and I am not happy with terms of reference that exclude it.</p> <p pid=".811.3/2">I turn to the report's points on terrorism. In paragraph 126, the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISC">ISC</a> refers to the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JIC">JIC</a> assessment that</p> <p class="indent" pid=".811.3/3">"al-Qaida and associated groups . . . represent by far the greatest terrorist threat to Western interests, and that threat would be heightened by military action against Iraq."</p> <p pid=".811.3/4">That was one of a number of factors to be considered, but it was not one to which Ministers alluded. The impression that they sought to give was often very different, as they suggested that the greatest threat from terrorism would be from the continuance of the Saddam Hussein regime&#8212;evil though it was. The Prime <a href="/glossary/?gl=35" title="Ministers make up the Government and almost all are members of the House of..." class="glossary">Minister</a> currently takes refuge in a phrase that refers to the "nexus between terrorism and weapons of mass destruction"&#8212;a vague and imprecise concept that I do not remember ever seeing in any intelligence assessment, and which does not address the question of that particular threat&#8212;that holder of weapons of mass destruction, that terrorist group, and the possibility of a link between the two. If Members had known more about the available intelligence on the dangers that would arise with regime collapse, they would have wanted to take that into account. I am not saying that it would necessarily have changed their judgment, but that intelligence factor was omitted.</p>            </div>

Gentleman is entirely correct, and I am grateful to him for adding to my argument.</p> <p pid=".812.1/2">I want to refer to the BBC and, like others today, emphasise that the mistakes that its management made, which have been paid for in resignations, should not lead to any undermining of its independence or to the exercise of any leverage in negotiations over the charter or the licence fee. An independent BBC is very important to us.</p> <p pid=".812.1/3">I shall take the greatest of all possible political risks and comment on the "Today" programme, which plays a significant part in many of our lives. The resignations and top management changes&#8212;of heads rather than deputy heads&#8212;have perhaps led us to miss a point about the pressures that programmes are currently under in reporting such matters. The "Today" programme has come under pressure, from past editors, I suspect, to concentrate on getting the story first, rather than getting the story right. The frequent use of expressions such as, "This programme has learned," and "<a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_BBC">The BBC</a> has been told," suggest that the programme is engaged in a ratings war with the newspapers. We look to a programme like that, for which we all have great affection, to get a story right, and we frankly do not care if its story appears later than a story in some newspaper that is speculative and wrong. I am sure that many of those who make the programme are trying to abide by that principle, but they should have it reinforced in the processes that follow the <a href="/glossary/?gl=7" title="http://www.the-hutton-inquiry.org.uk/content/report/" class="glossary">Hutton report</a>.</p> <p pid=".812.1/4">Another feature that I want to mention is not peculiar to the "Today" programme but applies to news bulletins as well&#8212;I believe that that is a factor in some of these problems. It is the interview format adopted when correspondents explain a matter. This used to be done by a correspondent appearing in front of camera and saying some rather carefully prepared words. Having a journalist interviewed at 7 minutes past 6 in the morning from his home is likely to lead to words not being carefully chosen at all. I do not believe that that was the only factor in the Gilligan error&#8212;indeed, the Gilligan falsehood, as Hutton rightly rules it&#8212;but presentational pressure to make the statement of a well informed correspondent appear like an interview or a casual conversation between him and the presenter does not contribute to ensuring that the story is right. Those of us who value the BBC highly look to it to get the story right&#8212;we do not care whether it gets it first&#8212;and presentation is not the most important issue.</p> <p pid=".812.1/5">Having concluded with those comments, I think I have made sure that I shall not appear on the "Today" programme for quite some time. That will make my mornings more comfortable.</p>            </div>

                                  <div class="debate-speech__content">                <p pid=".813.0/1">I adopt everything that <a href="/mp/?m=724" title="Our page on Alan Beith - 'the right hon. Member for Berwick-upon-Tweed (Mr. Beith)'">Mr. Beith</a> has said.</p> <p pid=".813.0/2">Seven days is a long time in politics. A week ago, I criticised the <a href="/glossary/?gl=175" title="The &quot;Leader of the Opposition&quot; is head of &quot;Her Majesty's Official..." class="glossary">Leader of the Opposition</a> for what I deemed an unworthy response to the <a href="/glossary/?gl=264" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prime_Minister_of_the_United_Ki ngdom" class="glossary">Prime Minister</a>. Today, I commend him for his highly constructive contribution to the debate.</p> <p pid=".813.0/3"><a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lord_Hutton">Lord Hutton</a> published his report last week. He is a distinguished judge, whose appointment was greeted with acclamation. He is a man of undoubted integrity and independence. The conduct of his inquiry was also praised. I appeared before him for almost two hours, and therefore have some idea of the care that he took. He agonised long over the conclusions that he reached. That was also the general impression conveyed by the press at the time. Lord Hutton was hailed as</p> <p class="indent" pid=".813.0/4">"a Judge not afraid to stand up to the Establishment".</p> <p pid=".813.0/5">He was commended for his "fearless independence", for being</p> <p class="indent" pid=".813.0/6">"very much his own man", and for being "shrewd and astute". One journalist identified in him</p> <p class="indent" pid=".813.0/8">"a sharpness of mind and efficiency that stunned witnesses and journalists".</p> <p pid=".813.0/9">Suddenly, however, when the report was published, Lord Hutton was blamed for his "naivet&#233;", and for his "unbalanced document". The charge of "whitewash" was common currency, even on the front pages of the newspapers. There was widespread disappointment and frustration that Lord Hutton did not take the scalps of any senior politicians, including that of my right hon. Friend the <a href="/glossary/?gl=23" title="Secretary of State was originally the title given to the two officials who..." class="glossary">Secretary of State</a> for Defence, who I am delighted to say was wholly absolved by the report.</p> <p pid=".813.0/10">This tells us much about the state of British democracy. Of course the press is the bulwark of our freedom. Its ability to question, using investigative journalism, is absolutely vital, but this should be coupled with responsibility. There is a danger of the press subverting our democracy by creating a climate of mistrust and malice towards those in public life, cynically hunting in packs for its next victim. There must surely be a middle way between deference and malicious point scoring, and between questioning scepticism and corroding cynicism.</p> <p pid=".813.0/11">Lord Hutton clearly interpreted his remit as requiring something broader than an inquest but narrower than an inquiry into the causes of war. In that, he was right. The quality of the intelligence involved must now be investigated. <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Kay">David Kay</a> told the Senate committee last week that we were all wrong. Of course, we learn of intelligence failures&#8212;indeed, Libya was another failure in terms of its nuclear capacity&#8212;but not of the successes. Some failures might have been due to Saddam Hussein having been deceived by his generals, or having sought to be duplicitous to others. Human intelligence might have been weak, or have relied too much on exiles. There could have been a "group think" among the experts because of the serial liar who was in charge of Iraq. There was of course a failure to record dissent within the security establishment. All these are important questions which the committee needs to address. But I agree with the broad conclusion of Lord Hutton, which of course the leader of the <a href="/glossary/?gl=29" title="The Opposition are the political parties in the House of Commons other than..." class="glossary">Opposition</a> accepted, too. <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_BBC">The BBC</a> was at fault. Ultimately it made a full apology. There was sloppy journalism, and there was no, or insufficient, rigorous questioning along the route.</p> <p pid=".813.0/12">Is it just old-fashioned of me, and perhaps the right hon. Member for Berwick-upon-Tweed, to say that the BBC's reputation was based on its practice in the past of reporting the news objectively, rather than seeking to make the news&#8212;a point made excellently by the editor of the <i><a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Financial_Times">Financial Times</a></i> in last Saturday's edition?</p> <p pid=".813.0/13">I should also like to say that <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mark_Byford">Mark Byford</a> is well known to the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foreign_Affairs_Committee">Foreign Affairs Committee</a>. I believe that he is a good choice in the interim, and hopefully beyond, to manage the BBC.</p> <p pid=".813.0/14">I hope also that the inquiry will not divert attention from the real challenges of peace in Iraq and of reconstructing that country.</p> <p pid=".813.0/15">I turn to the role of <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Select_Committees">Select Committees</a>, which my hon. Friend <a href="/mp/?m=1078" title="Our page on Andrew MacKinlay - 'the Member for Thurrock (Andrew Mackinlay)'">Andrew Mackinlay</a> mentioned. He addressed the question of access to information, individuals and documents. The Committees of the House have powers to send for persons, papers and records&#8212;<a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PPR">PPR</a>, in the jargon. In practice, however, the power is unenforceable against Ministers, because of the Government's parliamentary <a href="/glossary/?gl=37" title="The term &quot;majority&quot; is used in two ways in Parliament. Firstly a Government..." class="glossary">majority</a>.</p> <p pid=".813.0/16">In the course of our inquiry, the Foreign Affairs Committee reached conclusions that, save in one particular, were accepted by the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intelligence_and_Security_Committee">Intelligence and Security Committee</a>, which had access to all the intelligence that we asked for. We asked for <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alastair_Campbell">Alastair Campbell</a> to appear before us; we also asked for Scarlett, Omand, Dearlove and others. All this was refused to us, except, at the second time of trying, Alastair Campbell. Yet all gave evidence to an inquiry that lacked any power to compel their attendance.</p> <p pid=".813.0/17">Similarly, the Foreign Affairs Committee asked for drafts of the weapons of mass destruction dossier and other papers, so that we could look at the route it took step by step. Again, all those papers were denied to a Committee of Parliament, even in confidence, but are now all published for people to read on the <a href="/glossary/?gl=17" title="http://www.the-hutton-inquiry.org.uk/" class="glossary">Hutton inquiry</a> website. Surely that is wrong. If the House is to do its job, and its expert Committees are to do their job on behalf of the House and the public, we must be given the tools.</p> <p pid=".813.0/18">I made the point to my right hon. Friend the Prime <a href="/glossary/?gl=35" title="Ministers make up the Government and almost all are members of the House of..." class="glossary">Minister</a> yesterday in the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liaison_Committee">Liaison Committee</a>, and I made it to him this morning. I hope that this issue will not go away, and that the House will learn that as one of the key lessons of Hutton. Of course, as parliamentarians we are envious of the access of Hutton's inquiry to witnesses and information. The Government must take Parliament and its Committees more seriously.</p> <p pid=".813.0/19">As I have said, that is one of the key lessons to be learnt. The other is the light that the human tragedy of a good and distinguished public servant, Dr. Kelly, throws on the current climate of mistrust and cynicism fostered by the press with regard to those in public life, and the presumption that those in public life are at best to be mistrusted and at worst dishonest.</p> <p pid=".813.0/20">I trust that as a House we shall learn the lessons from this tragic episode and try to move forward in a spirit of greater humility, respect and indeed trust.</p>            </div>

                                  <div class="debate-speech__content">                <p pid=".816.1/1">The hon. Gentleman clearly has a keen understanding of these matters.</p> <p pid=".816.1/2">As <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lord_Hutton">Lord Hutton</a> himself observed, this may be subconsciously&#8212;he said "subconsciously"&#8212;corrupting. But I think that in the case of the influence of Downing street on the intelligence services it was clearly more than subconsciously corrupting, for there was a whole series of overt and explicit memos. In the spring and summer of 2002, the intelligence services had produced a fairly cautious document about the state of <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iraqi_weapons_of_mass_destruction">Iraqi weapons of mass destruction</a>. It may be remembered that the original document, which was not published because it was too feeble, said that there was a chemical and biological weapons capability, but made no mention of actual weapons. It said that Iraq was at least five years away from producing a nuclear weapon. That, of course, was not exactly what the editorial staff in Downing street wanted to hear.</p> <p pid=".816.1/3">Phil Bassett, himself a former journalist and a member of the Downing street press office, sent a memo saying,</p> <p class="indent" pid=".816.1/4">"We're in a lot of trouble as it stands now."</p> <p pid=".816.1/5">Another memo went out from Downing street saying,</p> <p class="indent" pid=".816.1/6">"<a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/No_10">No 10</a> through the Chairman wants the document to be as strong as possible within the bounds of the available" evidence.</p> <p class="indent" pid=".816.1/8">"Therefore this is a last (!) call for elements that agencies think can and should be included."</p> <p pid=".816.1/9">In due course, naturally, Scarlett obliged. He produced a dossier in which some of the language had been strengthened. But Campbell, the editor-in-chief, still was not happy. There was a sentence that read</p> <p class="indent" pid=".816.1/10">"The Iraq military may be able to deploy chemical or biological weapons within 45 minutes of an order to do so".</p> <p pid=".816.1/11">Mr. Campbell pointed out that that was weaker than the wording of the summary, and requested that it be changed. That request was granted, along with requests for a dozen other material changes designed to beef up the language.</p> <p pid=".816.1/12">Some analysts on the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Defence_Intelligence_Staff">Defence Intelligence Staff</a> were uneasy about the 45-minute claim. Dr. <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brian_Jones">Brian Jones</a>&#8212;whose intimate involvement with the whole business was discussed earlier by the <a href="/glossary/?gl=264" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prime_Minister_of_the_United_Ki ngdom" class="glossary">Prime Minister</a>&#8212;said:</p> <p class="indent" pid=".816.1/13">"The way the intelligence was reported did not give us any confidence that the primary source knew very much about the subject."</p> <p pid=".816.1/14">He went to see Dr. Kelly, who himself expressed some doubts about, for instance, the biological weapons claim, but when they passed their concerns up to their superiors those concerns were ignored. Jones said he felt that</p> <p class="indent" pid=".816.1/15">"the shutters were coming down".</p> <p pid=".816.1/16">An unnamed official was so alarmed by the draft that he wrote a highly unusual memo of protest:</p> <p class="indent" pid=".816.1/17">The 20th September draft still includes a number of statements which are not supported by the evidence available to me . . . What I wish to record is that based on the intelligence available to me, it has <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NOT">NOT</a> been established beyond doubt that Saddam has continued to produce chemical and biological weapons."</p> <p pid=".816.1/18">As for the notorious 45-minute claim, he said</p> <p class="indent" pid=".816.1/19">"This is based on a single source. It is not clear what is meant by 'weapons are deployable within 45 minutes'. The judgment is too strong considering the evidence on which it is based".</p> <p pid=".816.1/20">Yet four days later the Prime <a href="/glossary/?gl=35" title="Ministers make up the Government and almost all are members of the House of..." class="glossary">Minister</a> was at the <a href="/glossary/?gl=171" title="If you've ever seen inside the Commons, you'll notice a large table in the..." class="glossary">Dispatch Box</a> waving a dossier and making that claim no fewer than four times. He made it in his own foreword. He said:</p> <p class="indent" pid=".816.1/21">"The threat of Saddam and weapons of mass destruction is not American or British propaganda. The history and present threat are real".</p> <p pid=".816.1/22">A couple of hours beforehand <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jonathan_Powell">Jonathan Powell</a> had sent a memo to <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alastair_Campbell">Alastair Campbell</a>&#8212;someone mentioned this earlier&#8212;saying:</p> <p class="indent" pid=".816.1/23">"Alastair, what will the headline be in the Standard" after they had published this thing?</p> <p class="indent" pid=".816.1/25">"What do we want it to be?"</p> <p pid=".816.1/26">We do not have Campbell's answer, but I think we can guess, because the <i><a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evening_Standard">Evening Standard</a></i> duly obliged the Government's propaganda machine and said "45 minutes from attack".</p> <p pid=".816.1/27"><i>The Sun</i> said, "He's got 'em . . . Let's get him." It was nonsense, of course. It was an inverted pyramid of piffle. To make matters worse, the Government allowed the tabloids to misconstrue the 45-minute reference to mean ground or air-launched missiles rather than battlefield weapons. In other words, a claim that was rubbish had been embellished at the Government's behest and at the specific request of Alastair Campbell.</p> <p pid=".816.1/28">Let us go back to the fateful change and the psychology of the parties involved. The intelligence services are already straining to oblige their political masters and they have beefed up the language as far as they dare, but Campbell comes back to Scarlett and wants him to ratchet it up one notch higher. He wants to move the claim from the conditional to the indicative mood, as the grammarians would say. Why does Scarlett accede to that? Because he is in the position of a foreign correspondent who has before him a campaigning editor, but the story is not quite hot or strong enough, so he agrees to hype it up. He takes a risk because he thinks he can get away with it because the facts may well turn out to support his editor's desire and he wants a quiet life and to be obliging.</p> <p pid=".816.1/29">That is, in essence, what <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andrew_Gilligan">Andrew Gilligan</a> reported. He said that the Government probably knew that the figure was wrong. They and Campbell certainly did not know that the figure was right, yet they put it before the public and before Parliament as an incontrovertible fact. Gilligan said that his source was involved in the production of the dossier, which was certainly true. He said that there was anxiety in the intelligence services about the dossier, which has been amply confirmed.</p> <p pid=".816.1/30">I ask Labour Members who deride Gilligan whether they are happy that those facts were brought into the public domain. I also ask them in their triumphalism to reflect on whether it is possible that the Government made mistakes in the production of the dossier&#8212;</p>            </div>

                                  <div class="debate-speech__content">                <p pid=".818.0/1">The time limit makes it difficult for me to respond to the interesting remarks of <a href="/mp/?m=999" title="Our page on Boris Johnson - 'the hon. Member for Henley (Mr. Johnson)'">Mr. Johnson</a>. I will focus my brief remarks on three areas: the publication of intelligence, the future of the BBC and the intelligence on <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iraqi_weapons_of_mass_destruction">Iraqi weapons of mass destruction</a>.</p> <p pid=".818.0/2">First, on the publication of intelligence, the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intelligence_and_Security_Committee">Intelligence and Security Committee</a>'s report on Iraqi WMD says that we intended to examine the agencies' relationship with the media and the use of intelligence-derived material by the Government to brief the public. The dossier published in September 2002 was the first of its kind, and we can learn much from the experiment. <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lord_Hutton">Lord Hutton</a> has shown us that the rules were not broken in the drafting of the dossier, and I am pleased that the Government have been cleared in that way.</p> <p pid=".818.0/3">The rules were not broken, but the question we must ask ourselves now is whether we have the right rules. My view is that we do not&#8212;not yet. I believe that the Government should operate with a presumption of openness. Intelligence, however, is obviously inherently different. For good reason, the intelligence agencies work in secret and much of their findings is kept secret. If, however, intelligence on issues of great national importance can be made public without jeopardising the work of the agencies, a case can be made for publishing it. In theory, that should enable the public to have a more informed debate on the subject in question. The question is: who should publish that work and on what terms?</p> <p pid=".818.0/4">Let me be clear: I do not condemn the decision of my right hon. Friends to publish the dossier in September 2002. <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_House">The House</a> may recall that the Intelligence and Security Committee supported that decision in our annual report last year. But we have to learn the lessons of this whole affair, and my conclusion is that Governments should not, in future, be involved in the publication of intelligence-based documents.</p> <p pid=".818.0/5">Intelligence does not readily lend itself to publication. It is rarely cut and dried. The intelligence received is a stream of often conflicting or inconclusive data, from which people have to make judgments. It is for the Government to take decisions based on those judgments.</p> <p pid=".818.0/6">My view is that, by their very nature, Governments will be selective in their use of intelligence. A Government will tend to cite intelligence publicly only when trying to persuade the public on a difficult point. Sometimes a Government may take a decision that is in conflict with the balance of the available intelligence, but it is difficult to imagine such a Government choosing to publish a dossier full of that intelligence.</p> <p pid=".818.0/7">An alternative approach could be for the intelligence agencies alone to draft any intelligence-related documents to be published. Ministers would not be answerable for them, but the documents could be debated. One advantage of such an approach would be that there could then be no suspicion&#8212;however unfounded&#8212;of Government pressure or interference; and no possibility that any members of the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joint_Intelligence_Committee">Joint Intelligence Committee</a> might be "sub-consciously influenced", as Lord Hutton put it, to use wording stronger than would otherwise be used. The hon. Member for Henley made a lot of that.</p> <p pid=".818.0/8">A further advantage of that approach is that authorship of such reports would be clear. That is an important point for members of the public looking at the statements made at the time of the dossier's publication. Its authorship is not clear. Was it written by the intelligence services, or the Government?</p> <p pid=".818.0/9">In that context, one option would be for the intelligence agencies to publish annually a report of their assessment of security issues. My view, based on what has happened in the past couple of years, is that, as a general rule, intelligence material should not be published. Instead, the Government should set out their judgments in the normal way, in a statement to the House or in an official Government document. In the case of Iraq, the Government would have published their own document, setting out their considered view of the nature of the threat.</p> <p pid=".818.0/10">I turn now to the future of the BBC. It is important that we do not overreact. Clearly, <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andrew_Gilligan">Andrew Gilligan</a> made a mistake in his broadcast, which was compounded by the way that it was dealt with in the BBC chains of command. However, we must not respond in a way that would damage the BBC, which is a truly great British institution.</p> <p pid=".818.0/11">I was pleased that my right hon. Friend the <a href="/glossary/?gl=264" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prime_Minister_of_the_United_Ki ngdom" class="glossary">Prime Minister</a> assured my right hon. Friend <a href="/mp/?m=975" title="Our page on Alan Howarth - 'the Member for Newport, East (Alan Howarth)'">Alan Howarth</a>, my colleague on the Intelligence and Security Committee, that Lord Hutton's strictures against the BBC will not bias the Government in their consideration of the future of the charter and the licence fee.</p> <p pid=".818.0/12">Much of what the BBC currently does is policed by <a href="/glossary/?gl=217" title="Ofcom is the independent regulator and competition authority for the UK..." class="glossary">Ofcom</a>, but I believe that regulation of the BBC should not be transferred entirely to that body. <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_BBC">The BBC</a> is different from other broadcasters: it is a public service, paid for and owned by everyone. The BBC exists to set standards for others and to play a vital role in our democracy. One only has to look at what is served up in news bulletins in other countries to begin to recognise what an asset we have in the BBC.</p> <p pid=".818.0/13">Finally, important though the questions surrounding Andrew Gilligan's broadcasts were, and tragic though the death of <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dr_Kelly">Dr Kelly</a> was, at some point we must leave these discussions behind us. The real question is, why did we go to war?</p> <p pid=".818.0/14">For the UK, the central case was Iraq's weapons of mass destruction. There is the separate question of regime change, but the stated basis of the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/British_Government">British Government</a>'s decision to go to war was Iraq's WMD.</p> <p pid=".818.0/15">The past is the past. Whether or not there actually were <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WMD_in_Iraq">WMD in Iraq</a>, I believed that the UN weapons inspectors should have been given more time to do their job. The Government disagreed. I do not doubt that they acted in good faith, on the basis of the intelligence that they had. However, statements were made&#8212;about 45 minutes, the thousands of tonnes of WMD agent, and so on&#8212;that I do not believe that anyone here would make now.</p> <p pid=".818.0/16">As I have said, I do not doubt that the Government acted in good faith. We therefore have to ask ourselves whether the intelligence was wrong. We have all heard the statements by <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Kay">David Kay</a>, the outgoing leader of the Iraq survey group. He put the matter starkly when he told the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Senate_Armed_Services_Committee">Senate Armed Services Committee</a> last Wednesday,</p> <p class="indent" pid=".818.0/17">"We were all wrong, probably, in my judgment, and that is most disturbing."</p> <p pid=".818.0/18">I am not saying that there is nothing there. David Kay himself spoke of a programme to develop a weapon using ricin that was active until the war, and the Iraq survey group has not finished its work. However, it is looking less and less likely that Iraq possessed great stockpiles of chemical and biological weapons, or that there was large-scale production of chemical or biological weapons in Iraq.</p> <p pid=".818.0/19">Lord Hutton did not address that matter, and it is wrong to criticise him for not doing so, as that was not in his remit. Instead, he was judging whether the intelligence was properly presented, but the time has come to take stock of the intelligence itself. The fundamental questions now have to do with whether it was right to go to war in the first place and, given the present situation in Iraq, with the proper role of Britain and its armed forces.</p> <p pid=".818.0/20">As my right hon. Friend <a href="/mp/?m=1177" title="Our page on Joyce Quin - 'the Member for Gateshead, East and Washington, West (Joyce Quin)'">Joyce Quin</a> noted, intelligence material is only one of a number of factors that the Government had to weigh in the balance in taking the momentous decision to go to war. There is a feeling among the public that the intelligence may have been flawed. If the further inquiry that the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foreign_Secretary">Foreign Secretary</a> announced yesterday is able to cast some light on that, then it will be doing the country a service.</p>            </div>

                                  <div class="debate-speech__content">                <p pid=".820.0/1">I rather suspect that <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lord_Hutton">Lord Hutton</a>, if he pays any attention to such matters, will have been amused at the way in which the press lionised him at first and then turned against him when he did not produce the desired results. He may even share my amusement at the especially fatuous comment that his report lacked balance. The sentiment seems to have been that his criticism of the BBC meant that he should have criticised the Government as well.</p> <p pid=".820.0/2">That comment betrays a complete misconception of Lord Hutton's function. He is a judge who was asked to examine certain issues. He took evidence, saw and evaluated witnesses, and made what he considered to be findings of fact. Having looked at his report, I find it difficult to see any basis for differing from his findings on the facts, but of course whether those facts fit into someone's notion of balance is entirely another matter.</p> <p pid=".820.0/3">Some of the comments&#8212;especially some of the commentary&#8212;were silly. <a href="/mp/?m=1177" title="Our page on Joyce Quin - 'The right hon. Member for Gateshead, East and Washington, West (Joyce Quin)'">Joyce Quin</a> referred to a particular newspaper; I want to refer to a particular commentary, although I shall reveal neither the organ nor the author. Two thirds of the way through my example&#8212;a splendid denunciation of Lord Hutton&#8212;was a little sentence saying that the author had not had time to study the report in detail, which being translated meant that he had not read it.</p> <p pid=".820.0/4">I turn from that commentary in an outlet that has a high opinion of itself to the refreshingly different point of view of a former editor of <i>The Sun&#8212;</i>Mr. Yelland, writing in <i><a href="/glossary/?gl=49" title="http://www.timesonline.co.uk/" class="glossary">The Times</a></i> on Friday. He said:</p> <p class="indent" pid=".820.0/5">"I can truly say that when I was Editor of <i>The Sun</i> that story would not have passed muster. I would have asked so many questions it would not have seen the light of day.</p> <p class="indent" pid=".820.0/6">And if it did get in the paper and Campbell had called me, I would have gone through the reporter's notes and, in this case, I would have fired him."</p> <p pid=".820.0/7">The claim further on in the paper that the tabloid press still retains some of the values of reporters of fact, whereas so much of the quality press is now dominated by commentators who wish to make an impact and a political point is a good one. Although, as a balance to those comments, <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andreas_Whittam_Smith">Andreas Whittam Smith</a>, in <i>The Independent</i>, made the good point that the BBC needs a strong editorial function.</p> <p pid=".820.0/8">I do not have time to go into details, but the e-mails sent by <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kevin_Marsh">Kevin Marsh</a> of the "Today" programme are reproduced on page 195 of the <a href="/glossary/?gl=7" title="http://www.the-hutton-inquiry.org.uk/content/report/" class="glossary">Hutton report</a>. He listed eight points that should be introduced to ensure a proper editorial regime over the matters that Mr. Gilligan would deal with in future on the programme. Mention of those points concedes that such editorial control did not exist before that.</p> <p pid=".820.0/9">I was struck by the comments on the Marsh memorandum included elsewhere in the report. Mr. Dyke said that it had not been brought to his attention and when that was queried, he replied:</p> <p class="indent" pid=".820.0/10">"This is further down the chain, quite a long way down the chain".</p> <p pid=".820.0/11">Similar comments made by Mr. Sambrook and Mr. Davies indicate that persons in the upper echelons of the BBC did not regard the comments of the editor of their flagship current affairs radio programme as something worthy of their attention, or that should even have been brought to their attention. A decent editorial structure in the BBC would be quite different from that, and I hope that the BBC will address that problem, as well as looking into the culture that has developed of making news rather than providing decent analysis of it.</p> <p pid=".820.0/12">Reference has been made to maintaining the independence of the BBC. That is important, but we need integrity at the BBC, too. I am sorry to have to tell the House that, where I come from, that integrity has sometimes not existed. A journalist who now writes for a left-wing newspaper but who, at the time, was the security correspondent for <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BBC_Northern_Ireland">BBC Northern Ireland</a> gave me one such example. When Garda Gerry McCabe was murdered in the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Irish_Republic">Irish Republic</a>, that BBC security correspondent received, from three separate sources, confirmation that the murder was committed by the IRA and the names of the four persons who are currently serving prison terms, but was told, "Oh no, you can't report that, because it's based on supposition". BBC Northern Ireland then broadcast an interview with a <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sinn_Fein">Sinn Fein</a> luvvie, who said, "Oh no, it was the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Irish_National_Liberation_Army">Irish National Liberation Army</a>". I connect that misrepresentation with the circumstance that someone at a senior level in BBC Northern Ireland was arrested in the early 1960s trying to set fire to an Army recruitment office. The case was hushed up because that youngster was then, as now, very well connected. These are questions of integrity. We need to return to a proper sense of public service broadcasting.</p> <p pid=".820.0/13">A new, fresh inquiry has been announced, and I welcome that. Although I realise that it is in no way connected with the comments that I made in the House a week ago about the need for such an inquiry, I am glad, for other reasons, that it has been set up. It is good that the inquiry will be able to look into the gathering, evaluation and use of intelligence, but it is important that that be done in as cool a way as possible. It is curious, too, to read the comments of Dr. Jones today, in which he is clearly concerned about the overstatement of intelligence. As has been said, intelligence is a matter of judgment; it is uncertain. Dr. Jones is concerned that his superiors in the intelligence world were overstating things that he thought should still be qualified. Again, where I come from, there is a strong belief among people who deal with intelligence matters on the ground in Northern Ireland that the chief function of the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JIC">JIC</a> over the years has been to tone down and take out of the intelligence presented to the Government any awkward or inconvenient fact. There is good reason to believe that that is, in fact, what the JIC has tended to do over the past few years, and I wish that the Government would probe a little bit more deeply into those matters as well.</p> <p pid=".820.0/14">I wish the fresh inquiry well. It is important that we look back to see what mistakes have been made if only to ensure that performance is better in the future, but I do not think that those inquiries&#8212;whether those conducted by Lord Hutton or by the fresh inquiry&#8212;change the basic political decision that the House took in March last year. Indeed, what we have heard today from Mr. Kay reinforces that. However, independently of that, I am quite satisfied that the decision that we took then was right and, as the <a href="/glossary/?gl=264" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prime_Minister_of_the_United_Ki ngdom" class="glossary">Prime Minister</a> said towards the end of his contribution, the middle east&#8212;indeed, perhaps the world&#8212;is a better place as a result.</p>            </div>

Member for Upper Bann (Mr. Trimble)'">Mr. Trimble</a> said, part of the difficulty is that the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JIC">JIC</a> has often geared itself to what it thinks its masters want to hear, so should there not be a distinction between analysis and advocacy? I raised that issue in some detail in the debate in the House on <phrase class="date" code="2004-07-03">3 July</phrase>, at column 601. I have a letter dated <phrase class="date" code="2004-07-16">16 July</phrase> from the <a href="/glossary/?gl=264" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prime_Minister_of_the_United_Ki ngdom" class="glossary">Prime Minister</a> asserting:</p> <p class="indent" pid=".822.0/2">"I have also made it clear that the Chairman of the JIC was responsible for the executive summary and the body of the text. At no time during the process did anyone attempt to override the intelligence judgements of the Chairman of the JIC and his Committee.</p> <p class="indent" pid=".822.0/3">The foreword was put to the Chairman of the JIC who confirmed at the time that there was nothing which conflicted with the contents of the dossier."</p> <p pid=".822.0/4">I have a constructive suggestion to make: there should be a directive to the JIC and, through it, to the entire intelligence community that there should always be a distinction between analysis and advocacy. That might be helpful to the intelligence community because, like many others, I am very uneasy about those in the intelligence community having to shoulder a blame that they do not deserve.</p> <p pid=".822.0/5">As time is short, I shall be as brief as possible, but I have one other matter that I should like to raise with those on the <a href="/glossary/?gl=122" title="The first bench on either side of the House of Commons, reserved for..." class="glossary">Front Bench</a>. Towards the end of his speech, the Prime <a href="/glossary/?gl=35" title="Ministers make up the Government and almost all are members of the House of..." class="glossary">Minister</a> chose to raise the question of the present situation in Iraq. May I repeat that there is increasing need for the west to show an example in at least bringing to trial people who may have done dreadful things, just as people who did dreadful things between 1939 and 1945&#8212;indeed, before that&#8212;were brought to trial at Nuremburg? If we are to going to dampen an increasingly dangerous situation, in which our forces are seen, rightly or wrongly, as an occupying army, it is a matter of absolute urgency that those trials be set in motion.</p> <p pid=".822.0/6">I have a final question. Is it true, as is coming from certain sources in Washington, that Saddam Hussein is being held at the biggest base outside the continental United States, at <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diego_Garcia">Diego Garcia</a>, which is, after all, a <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/British_Indian">British Indian</a> ocean territory?

It certainly came as a significant surprise to members of the Committee. <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Committee">The Committee</a>, to quote just one of our recommendations, recommendation 12, was in absolutely no doubt that it was dangerous and unacceptable:</p> <p class="indent" pid=".823.4/3">"We conclude that it was wrong for <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alistair_Campbell">Alistair Campbell</a> or any <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special_Adviser">Special Adviser</a> to have chaired a meeting on an intelligence matter, and we recommend that this practice cease."</p> <p pid=".823.4/4">As we know, what the Foreign Affairs Committee uncovered was just the tip of the iceberg. When the <a href="/glossary/?gl=17" title="http://www.the-hutton-inquiry.org.uk/" class="glossary">Hutton inquiry</a> got under way, and we saw the flood of e-mails that were being exchanged within the Government, to some of which my hon. Friend <a href="/mp/?m=999" title="Our page on Boris Johnson - 'the Member for Henley (Mr. Johnson)'">Mr. Johnson</a> has referred, it became clear that there was an absolutely unprecedented interleaving of those responsible for the Government's presentation, particularly in No. 10, with the intelligence agencies. That is a very serious issue for Government to address. As long as in this House, and just as importantly among the wider public, there is a general perception that intelligence material is subject to a degree of presentational input before it comes into the public domain, doubt will be cast on the independence, and indeed the integrity and professionalism, of the intelligence services.</p> <p pid=".823.4/5">A more significant matter for the longer term, which should worry the <a href="/glossary/?gl=23" title="Secretary of State was originally the title given to the two officials who..." class="glossary">Secretary of State</a> for Defence, if he is paying attention, is that if at a later date the <a href="/glossary/?gl=264" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prime_Minister_of_the_United_Ki ngdom" class="glossary">Prime Minister</a>, the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foreign_Secretary">Foreign Secretary</a> or he comes to the House and says, "We have found new intelligence of evidence of weapons of mass destruction, and we now need to take some form of military action to deal with that", the Government will be seriously at risk of running into a gale of scepticism and doubt, which perhaps should not be there. This is a very serious issue for the Government; I ask them seriously to consider reverting to the practice of all previous Governments by clearly separating the intelligence machinery from the presentational machinery.</p> <p pid=".823.4/6">The second issue that I want to raise is that of weapons of mass destruction. Another unique feature of the situation that arose in connection with the decision to go to war in Iraq is that, unlike the decision on any previous conflict, it was taken on the basis not of indisputable factual evidence of an invasion, a terrible terrorist attack or an impending massive humanitarian disaster, but of an assessed intelligence threat to British interests and those elsewhere. I acknowledge that that presented Ministers with a very significant difficulty, but it also presented them with a very serious obligation&#8212;namely, to scrutinise, question and evaluate the intelligence assessment most closely.</p> <p pid=".823.4/7">At the moment, we lack any evidence&#8212;certainly, the Hutton inquiry is wholly silent on this&#8212;that senior Ministers, especially the Prime <a href="/glossary/?gl=35" title="Ministers make up the Government and almost all are members of the House of..." class="glossary">Minister</a>, the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Defence_Secretary">Defence Secretary</a> and the Foreign Secretary, subjected the intelligence assessments to the degree of scrutiny and evaluation that should have taken place before they took the key decision to take this country to war. What questions were asked? <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_House">The House</a> and the wider public would wish to know the answer to that. For example, did the Prime Minister ever ask why, if the 45-minute claim was seen to be reliable as far as British intelligence was concerned, it was so clearly seen to be unreliable by the US Administration that they never used it?</p> <p pid=".823.4/8">Another question, which my hon. Friend <a href="/mp/?m=1147" title="Our page on Richard Ottaway - 'the Member for Croydon, South (Richard Ottaway)'">Richard Ottaway</a> asked today, is: did the Prime Minister ask to which weapons of mass destruction supposedly possessed by Saddam Hussein the 45-minute claim related? <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Prime_Minister">The Prime Minister</a>'s answer was absolutely extraordinary. He said that when he came to this House on <phrase class="date" code="2004-03-18">18 March</phrase> last year to ask for its approval to go to war, he did not know to which weapons of mass destruction the 45-minute claim related. That is an extraordinary admission.</p> <p pid=".823.4/9">My next question relates to chemical and biological weapons. Did the Prime Minister and his fellow Ministers ever ask, before repeating in the September dossier and at the <a href="/glossary/?gl=171" title="If you've ever seen inside the Commons, you'll notice a large table in the..." class="glossary">Dispatch Box</a> figures indicating very large tonnages of chemical weapons and chemical precursors, to what extent they had degraded, possibly beyond use? That information was widely available in the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Institute_for_Strategic_Studies">International Institute for Strategic Studies</a> and in the working document produced by <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UNMOVIC">UNMOVIC</a>&#8212;the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Nations_Monitoring,_Verification_and_Inspection_Commission">United Nations Monitoring, Verification and Inspection Commission</a>.</p>            </div>

                                  <div class="debate-speech__content">                <p pid=".825.2/1">In nothing that I have said in the House or outside it about Iraq have I ever questioned the good faith with which the <a href="/glossary/?gl=264" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prime_Minister_of_the_United_Ki ngdom" class="glossary">Prime Minister</a> believed in his case. I therefore welcome unreservedly the clear conclusion of <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lord_Hutton">Lord Hutton</a> that the Prime <a href="/glossary/?gl=35" title="Ministers make up the Government and almost all are members of the House of..." class="glossary">Minister</a> did not lie. Indeed, if I may say so to my colleagues, my frustration in those last few months before the war was not any suspicion that my right hon. Friend was acting duplicitously, but the sheer impossibility of shaking his open and passionate conviction that he was correct in his view that military confrontation was the right course.</p> <p pid=".825.2/2">We should of course remember that, at that time, those on the <a href="/glossary/?gl=29" title="The Opposition are the political parties in the House of Commons other than..." class="glossary">Opposition</a> <a href="/glossary/?gl=122" title="The first bench on either side of the House of Commons, reserved for..." class="glossary">Front Bench</a> fully shared the same passionate conviction. I sat beside my right hon. Friend the Prime Minister on the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Front_Bench">Front Bench</a> during a number of the exchanges, and frankly, the only challenge that he got from the then Conservative leader was a competition to see who could be more enthusiastic about a war. It does not compensate for the failure of the Opposition to scrutinise these matters at the time to have demanded over the past couple of months an inquiry into how the country ended up in a war that they fully supported. Personally, I gave up demanding an inquiry at about the same time as they started calling for one, partly because I was convinced that enough evidence was now in the public domain to make it plain that Saddam Hussein had not been a threat. Having sat through yesterday's exchange on the announcement of the inquiry, I feel that I was wise in not calling for it.</p> <p pid=".825.2/3">All that I would suggest to my hon. Friends about that inquiry is a piece of helpful advice. I suggest that they should stop trying to pretend that our decision to call an inquiry has nothing to do with the decision to call an inquiry over in Washington. Until Saturday, the Government were resisting the call for an inquiry. By Monday, they were organising one. Plainly, the only thing that had changed in between was that <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/President_Bush">President Bush</a> had announced that he wanted the facts. It speaks volumes about the extent of our culture of dependency on the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bush_Administration">Bush Administration</a> that as soon as they decide to have an inquiry, we too decide that it is a good thing.</p> <p pid=".825.2/4">That goes to the heart of the origins of the war. The truth is that the Bush Administration were convinced of the case for war long before they ever looked at any intelligence. We have Paul O'Neill's observation that, at the very first meeting of the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Security_Council">National Security Council</a>, the invasion of Iraq was topic A, and President Bush's approach was to say, "Get me a way of doing it." The reality is that intelligence was not the origin of the war; intelligence was used as the justification for a decision that had been taken for other reasons.</p> <p pid=".825.2/5">I welcome what the Prime Minister said today in praise of the intelligence agencies. For four years I was the <a href="/glossary/?gl=108" title="The cabinet is the group of twenty or so (and no more than 22) senior..." class="glossary">Cabinet</a> Minister with responsibility for the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secret_Intelligence_Service">Secret Intelligence Service</a>. I was always impressed by the service's detachment, and its meticulous qualification of what it offered. I say to my hon. Friend <a href="/mp/?m=838" title="Our page on Tam Dalyell - 'the Member for Linlithgow (Mr. Dalyell)'">Mr. Dalyell</a> that I never once knew the intelligence services to advocate a particular course of action. Indeed, the intelligence assessments were always so carefully balanced and full of alternative interpretations that I frequently rose from them more confused than when I had sat down in the first place. What went wrong in this case is that intelligence was used as propaganda to lobby for a war that had been decided on for reasons other than intelligence.</p> <p pid=".825.2/6">I read with great unease the article in today's edition of <i>The Independent</i> by Dr. <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brian_Jones">Brian Jones</a>. I do not wish to spend time discussing whether his comments were properly handled by his line manager. For me, the bottom line is that I find it extraordinary that neither the Cabinet nor Parliament were told that all the experts in the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Defence_Intelligence_Staff">Defence Intelligence Staff</a> had reservations about the September dossier.</p> <p pid=".825.2/7">There is one question that I have for the Butler inquiry to consider. I think that it falls within its remit, however narrow that may be. I have never doubted that Ministers believed all the information in the September dossier when that dossier was presented to Parliament, but I would be surprised if they believed all of it by the time the House was asked in March to vote for war. I say that because in between those two points we had two months of inspections by <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hans_Blix">Hans Blix</a> and the UN weapons inspectors in Iraq. We had given those inspectors, perfectly properly and correctly, our intelligence to guide them where to look, and they found nothing. Hans Blix has observed, "<a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/My_God">My God</a>, if this was their best intelligence, what was the rest like?"</p> <p pid=".825.2/8">Those blank results were fed back to our intelligence agencies by the weapons inspectors. I would like the Butler inquiry to consider whether that knowledge that our intelligence had proved faulty changed any of the evaluation by the intelligence agencies of the threat from Saddam. If so, why did Ministers not tell the House before we went to war?</p> <p pid=".825.2/9">I shall pick up on the exchange between <a href="/mp/?m=1147" title="Our page on Richard Ottaway - 'the hon. Member for Croydon, South (Richard Ottaway)'">Richard Ottaway</a> and my right hon. Friend the Prime Minister earlier this afternoon. If I heard it correctly&#8212;I may have misheard it&#8212;the hon. Gentleman asked my right hon. Friend whether he was aware by March that we were considering battlefield weapons rather than wider long-range weapons of mass destruction.</p> <p pid=".825.2/10">If I heard him correctly, my right hon. Friend the Prime Minister said no. I am bound to say that I was surprised by that answer. <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_House">The House</a> will recall that in my resignation speech I made the very point that we were considering battlefield weapons and that Saddam probably had no real weapons of mass destruction. I invite my right hon. Friend the <a href="/glossary/?gl=23" title="Secretary of State was originally the title given to the two officials who..." class="glossary">Secretary of State</a> for Defence, who will reply to the debate, to consider with his advisers whether it might not be wise to qualify the Prime Minister's answer when he replies. I find it difficult to reconcile with what I knew, and what I am sure my right hon. Friend the Prime Minister knew when we had the vote in March.</p>            </div>

Intelligence indicating that chemical weapons remained disassembled and that Saddam had not yet ordered their assembly, and that was highlighted."</p> <p pid=".827.1/6">That is light years away from what the House was told in September.

I offer personal credit to my right hon.

We now know that we did have the time to let <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hans_Blix">Hans Blix</a> finish the inspections, and had we done so we would have found out that there were no weapons of mass destruction, and there was no threat from Saddam.</p> <p pid=".827.1/9">It has become fashionable to talk about the judgment of history.

Member for Livingston (Mr. Cook)'">Mr. Cook</a> and my right hon. Friend <a href="/mp/?m=1248" title="Our page on John Stanley - 'the Member for Tonbridge and Malling (Sir John Stanley)'">Sir John Stanley</a>, but I hope that they will forgive me if I refer back to an earlier contribution by <a href="/mp/?m=1078" title="Our page on Andrew MacKinlay - 'the hon. Member for Thurrock (Andrew Mackinlay)'">Andrew Mackinlay</a> who was much maligned and vilified for his questioning on the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foreign_Affairs_Committee">Foreign Affairs Committee</a> at the time. I am poles apart from him politically, but I want to place on record the fact that I greatly respect what he did then, and does every day, as a parliamentarian. He deserves our respect, and he should know that he has support across the House.</p> <p pid=".828.0/2">I want to focus on key questions that were left unanswered by Hutton and which I hope will be answered by the next inquiry&#8212;and if not, by the Government. First, however, I shall put on record the fact that I voted for war on <phrase class="date" code="2004-03-18">18 March</phrase> despite the fact that after carefully reading the dossier and the Blix report, I had come to the conclusion that there almost certainly were no weapons of mass destruction in the hands of Saddam Hussein, and certainly none that constituted a current and serious threat to this country.</p> <p pid=".828.0/3">Close reading of those documents also made it clear to me that Saddam had in the past possessed and used those weapons, he had the current intention to possess them, and if we withdrew and sanctions collapsed, he would in future, in all likelihood, get them and become a danger. So I voted, knowing that there were no weapons but believing that it was possible to justify war to change the regime and pre-empt a future threat. I think that the <a href="/glossary/?gl=264" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prime_Minister_of_the_United_Ki ngdom" class="glossary">Prime Minister</a> was doing the right thing but giving the wrong reason, and it is important that we hold him to account for the reasons that he gave, lest a Government in future feel free to do whatever they like for the wrong reason.</p> <p pid=".828.0/4">The first question that we ought to ask is why the Government placed such enormous reliance on the alleged existence of weapons of mass destruction. It is clear that the decision to go to war did not follow from a study of the evidence of the existence of those weapons. The right hon. Member for Livingston said that it was the other way round: the decision came first and then the evidence was assembled to justify it. We know that because the key piece of evidence on which the Government relied so much that they put it in the dossier four times&#8212;the 45-minute claim&#8212;was not available to them when the decision was made but only at the last minute after they decided to produce the dossier.</p> <p pid=".828.0/5">The reason why the Government based the case for war on Saddam's supposed possession of weapons of mass destruction was, as so often with this Government, presentational. They chose the argument that they believed would maximise support, particularly among their <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Back_Benchers">Back Benchers</a> and in the United Nations. They chose it not because they believed it to be true but because it would maximise support. They thought that war to disarm Saddam of weapons of mass destruction would play well with the many Labour Members who have belonged to the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Campaign_for_Nuclear_Disarmament">Campaign for Nuclear Disarmament</a> and could be expected to support disarmament of all kinds. We know that that did not work: so many of those Members opposed their Government's decision that if this party had not joined the Government in the Lobby they would have been defeated and would have fallen.</p> <p pid=".828.0/6">The second question that we have to ask is whether, if the Government had known or been willing to accept at the time that there were no weapons of mass destruction available to Saddam, the war would have been legal. I made it clear that I voted for it as a war of regime change and pre-emptive action&#8212;a contentious position. Some argue that any war to change a regime is forbidden by international law. That seems a rather odd argument, given that we had already changed the regime of one third of the country. When we did that in Kurdistan and the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marsh_Arab">Marsh Arab</a> areas by military action and overflying, no one seemed to challenge it. If it was right to do that in a third of the country, I cannot see why it should be wrong in the other two thirds.</p> <p pid=".828.0/7">Others argued that one could not take military action to pre-empt a future threat, as if we should sit here and wait until <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tel_Aviv">Tel Aviv</a> had been nuked or Portsmouth poisoned. If we have the power and can take pre-emptive action, there may be occasions when it is justified. The issues need to be established clearly, because the same arguments may be deployed again with respect to other rogue states in apparent possession of, or threatening to possess, weapons of mass destruction.</p>            </div>

Gentleman raises an important issue, which concerns the role of the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Law_Officers">Law Officers</a>, who I suspect played an important part. We have seen their truncated conclusion, but we have never seen the full opinion or the submission on which it was based, and we do not know the extent to which they relied on that submission. That information should be available to the new inquiry, to establish whether the existence of weapons of mass destruction was relied on in their analysis.</p> <p pid=".830.1/2">We have to question the accountability of the Law Officers. They are very powerful, and once they have opined, a <a href="/glossary/?gl=108" title="The cabinet is the group of twenty or so (and no more than 22) senior..." class="glossary">Cabinet</a> is bound by that opinion. No Cabinet could afford to go against such an opinion for fear that it would be found to have done something that its own Law Officers said was illegal. In many cases that is all right, but international law is highly fluid, uncertain and subjective. In asking for an opinion, one is effectively making the Law Officers' subjective assessment binding on Government. We have to ask whether that is the right way to reach conclusions in such uncertain areas.</p> <p pid=".830.1/3">We need to ask whether Ministers or the intelligence services were to blame if intelligence was wrong. Ministers are responsible even for the advice that they take, so they have a duty to probe, question and evaluate that advice and get it right, as the right hon. Member for Livingston did&#8212;and even I, in my humble way, outside, could reach the same correct conclusion. In my experience, the worst decisions in Government are made when Ministers fail to question things because they are as enthusiastic as the officials, and officials fail to draw their attention to the problems, because they perhaps have an interest in heightening the appreciation of a certain risk or threat.</p>            </div>

The document said:</p> <p class="indent" pid=".830.3/3">"The <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JIC">JIC</a> concluded that Iraq had sufficient expertise, equipment and materials to produce biological warfare agents within weeks using its legitimate biotechnology facilities."</p> <p pid=".830.3/4">In the case of chemicals, the document said that Iraq could</p> <p class="indent" pid=".830.3/5">"produce significant quantities of mustard gas within weeks, and of nerve agents within months" and that the JIC concluded that</p> <p class="indent" pid=".830.3/7">"these chemical and biological capabilities represented the most immediate threat from <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iraqi_weapons_of_mass_destruction">Iraqi weapons of mass destruction</a>."</p> <p pid=".830.3/8">In other words, it was not that Iraq possessed such weapons but that it had the ability to produce them within weeks or months.</p> <p pid=".830.3/9"><a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_45">The 45</a>-minute claim was used so frequently not because it could be linked to the threat of missiles reaching here but because it was the only information in the document that implied that Iraq must already have the weapons, because it could get them to an unstated location 45 minutes later. That was the only evidence, and it contradicted the actual conclusions of the JIC, which is why so much was made of that claim.</p> <p pid=".830.3/10">The new inquiry should not start from the presumption that its task is to attach blame to the intelligence services. It should question how Ministers assessed the intelligence and presented it to the country. It should also ask whether the actual justification&#8212;a pre-emptive regime change&#8212;was justified in law, and whether we should be bound by the subjective opinion of the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Law_Officers">Law Officers</a>.</p>            </div>

                                  <div class="debate-speech__content">                <p pid=".831.0/1"><a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lord_Hutton">Lord Hutton</a> judged the BBC to be culpable. As a consequence, <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gavyn_Davies">Gavyn Davies</a> has gone, rightly and with dignity, and <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greg_Dyke">Greg Dyke</a> has gone, unwillingly and behaving like a buffoon. However, it is clear that those directly implicated in the Gilligan story, which Lord Hutton judged to be unfounded, remain active in the BBC.</p> <p pid=".831.0/2">On <phrase class="date" code="2004-07-06">6 July</phrase> last year, the BBC governors issued a statement endorsing the Gilligan story. The statement said that the story was in the public interest and that BBC journalists had good contacts in the security services. Four weeks after the Gilligan report, <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_Sambrook">Richard Sambrook</a>, the director of news, said in an interview on the "Today" programme:</p> <p class="indent" pid=".831.0/3">"we have nothing to apologise for . . . we had one senior and credible source in the intelligence services".</p> <p pid=".831.0/4">He continued deceptively to imply that the Gilligan story was based on a security or intelligence source. What is more, having learned that the source was not an intelligence official, he deliberately withheld that information from the board of governors, leading it to claim that there was an intelligence source. On that basis, the governors negligently and culpably endorsed the story and did not do their job.</p> <p pid=".831.0/5">Richard Sambrook was involved not only in that but, along with <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kevin_Marsh">Kevin Marsh</a>, in Gilligan's suborning of members of the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foreign_Affairs_Committee">Foreign Affairs Committee</a>. That is demonstrated by an e-mail&#8212;oh that mine enemy should send an e-mail&#8212;that Gilligan sent to Mark Damazer, Richard Sambrook and Kevin Marsh in which, among other things, he said:</p> <p class="indent" pid=".831.0/6">"Spoke to Ottaway again and he's happy".</p> <p pid=".831.0/7">He also discussed briefing members of the Foreign Affairs Committee and suggested more briefing and suborning of members of that Committee&#8212;that is all in the Hutton evidence.</p> <p pid=".831.0/8">The situation is worse than that. Downing street concentrated on <i><a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Mail_on_Sunday">The Mail on Sunday</a></i> article of <phrase class="date" code="2004-06-01">1 June</phrase> written by Gilligan, but he wrote two articles for the paper, the second one of which was published on <phrase class="date" code="2004-06-08">8 June</phrase>. It said, among other things, that the <a href="/glossary/?gl=264" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prime_Minister_of_the_United_Ki ngdom" class="glossary">Prime Minister</a></p> <p class="indent" pid=".831.0/9">"is charged with exaggeration, distortion, over-emphasis."</p> <p pid=".831.0/10">Kevin Marsh cleared that article. He read it, endorsed it and said, "It seems fine." That was the editor of the "Today" programme endorsing a contentious political article in a newspaper, and not seeing anything wrong in doing so. Indeed, far from it; the day after the Gilligan report on the "Today" programme that started this whole train of events, Marsh e-mailed Gilligan to say:</p> <p class="indent" pid=".831.0/11">"Great week; great stories, well handled and well told."</p> <p pid=".831.0/12">Those two, Sambrook and Marsh, are clinging to their jobs when it is clear that any sort of BBC journalistic probity demands that they go. A leading article in <i><a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Economist">The Economist</a></i> at the weekend said that the Gilligan report</p> <p class="indent" pid=".831.0/13">"was typical of much of modern British journalism: twisting or falsifying the supposed news to fit a journalist's opinion".</p> <p pid=".831.0/14">It went on to say that this action had been committed by</p> <p class="indent" pid=".831.0/15">"a public-service broadcaster, whose reputation for reliability and authority gave the report its very credibility."</p> <p pid=".831.0/16">Yet those people are still there. We do not simply have those executives; we also have a situation in which a publicly funded, public service broadcasting organisation has revealed its governance to be unacceptable. That was said in relation to this issue by Lord Hutton.</p> <p pid=".831.0/17">I had a long correspondence with Gavyn Davies, which began long before the Gilligan affair, in which he insisted that the BBC's</p> <p class="indent" pid=".831.0/18">"system of governance is a critical protection for the BBC's editorial independence from politicians".</p> <p pid=".831.0/19">As a member of the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Union">National Union</a> of Journalists for 49 years, I am strongly in favour of the BBC and, indeed, the printed press, being totally independent of any interference by politicians. However, if that is to happen, there has to be a converse. The converse is that the BBC, above all, has a duty to behave with responsibility and with a great respect for truth.</p>            </div>

It finances itself; it does not ask every household in the country to finance it. That is the burden of a free press. <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_BBC">The BBC</a> is different. It needs to be totally independent of all Governments. Governments must not interfere with the BBC's content, but if that is to be so, the BBC's governance must be changed. As many hon. Members know, I said this long before the Gilligan affair or the Iraq war.</p> <p pid=".832.1/3">The BBC is governed and run as it was 77 years ago. It is time that we had a public sector, public service broadcasting organisation that was independent of the Government but, nevertheless, run like a business in this cut-throat world of the media. In my view, that involves an executive chairman, a board of directors and a chief executive. In this episode, the members of the BBC's board of governors did not simply allow a wrong to continue; they let themselves down. They betrayed themselves and the BBC. I do not believe that that system of governance can be allowed to continue when the charter review takes place.</p>            </div>

Dr. Kelly remained anonymous after the <a href="/glossary/?gl=264" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prime_Minister_of_the_United_Ki ngdom" class="glossary">Prime Minister</a> expressed concern about the plan. However, <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sir_Kevin_Tebbit">Sir Kevin Tebbit</a>, the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MOD">MOD</a>'s most senior civil servant, told the inquiry that the Prime <a href="/glossary/?gl=35" title="Ministers make up the Government and almost all are members of the House of..." class="glossary">Minister</a> agreed with the strategy that led to the eventual outing of Dr. Kelly, in order, I think, to put him before parliamentary Committees.</p> <p pid=".833.0/3">We know of the discussion on the plane from Shanghai to <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hong_Kong">Hong Kong</a>, where the Prime Minister emphatically denied that he had had anything to do with it. On the other hand, on <phrase class="date" code="2004-10-13">13 October</phrase> Sir Kevin Tebbit said:</p> <p class="indent" pid=".833.0/4">"A policy decision on the handling of this matter had not been taken until the Prime Minister's meeting on Tuesday [<phrase class="date" code="2004-07-08">8 July</phrase>]. And it was only after that that any of the press people had an authoritative basis on which to proceed."</p> <p pid=".833.0/5">So obviously there is a doubt there.</p> <p pid=".833.0/6">On the question whether the dossier was embellished, sexed up or whatever, it seems plain to anyone who has read the evidence that that must be the case. <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lord_Hutton">Lord Hutton</a> may have concluded in another manner. That is fine. I am not impugning his impartiality, but I am calling into question the way in which he arrived at the decision. I am supported in that by several prominent lawyers, many of them Labour-supporting, such as <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geoffrey_Bindman">Geoffrey Bindman</a>. It is extraordinary that Lord Hutton should ignore the inconsistencies in coming to his conclusions.</p> <p pid=".833.0/7">What I am concerned about is that in the run-up to the debate and the vote we were not given evidence that could be relied upon. I am not all that upset about it, because I did not vote for the war, but I take issue over the Prime Minister's having said, in the foreword to the dossier,</p> <p class="indent" pid=".833.0/8">"I am in no doubt that the threat is serious and current" and so on, and then in September that the threat of the weapons of mass destruction programme was</p> <p class="indent" pid=".833.0/10">"active, detailed and growing . . . It is up and running".</p> <p pid=".833.0/11"><a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Scarlett">John Scarlett</a>, on the other hand, said when the document was launched:</p> <p class="indent" pid=".833.0/12">"We will need to make it clear in launching the document that we do not claim that we have evidence that he is an imminent threat."</p> <p pid=".833.0/13">That was the week before the Prime Minister said that the programme was up and running and that it was active, detailed and growing. There are evident inconsistencies here as well.</p> <p pid=".833.0/14">In today's edition of <i>The Independent</i> Dr. <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brian_Jones">Brian Jones</a> wrote:</p> <p class="indent" pid=".833.0/15">"the expert intelligence analysts of the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DIS">DIS</a> were overruled in the preparation of the dossier in September 2002 resulting in a presentation that was misleading about Iraq's capabilities."</p> <p pid=".833.0/16">I will not dwell on the 45 minutes claim. Suffice it to say that enough has been said about that today. I am far from clear as to what the truth is in that part of the report as well.</p> <p pid=".833.0/17">A letter from <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Martin_Howard">Martin Howard</a>, deputy chief of defence intelligence, to the <a href="/glossary/?gl=23" title="Secretary of State was originally the title given to the two officials who..." class="glossary">Secretary of State</a> for Defence attempted to brief the right hon. Gentleman about DIS dissent before he gave evidence to the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intelligence_and_Security_Committee">Intelligence and Security Committee</a>. I do not think that that took us anywhere. It is astonishing that the Government chose not to take the advice of these people, who were very concerned about embellishments and very concerned about the way in which the evidence was presented.</p> <p pid=".833.0/18">At page 133 of the report we have Alastair Campbell's minute to Scarlett of <phrase class="date" code="2004-09-17">17 September</phrase>:</p> <p class="indent" pid=".833.0/19">"Please find below a number of drafting points. As I was writing this, the Prime Minister had a read of the draft you gave me this morning, and he too made a number of points."</p> <p pid=".833.0/20">So it goes on.</p> <p pid=".833.0/21">Earlier today I referred to the appointment of <a href="/mp/?m=1269" title="Our page on Ann Taylor - 'the right hon. Member for Dewsbury (Ann Taylor)'">Ann Taylor</a> to the forthcoming inquiry. I think that it is inappropriate that she should serve on it. I shall read out verbatim an e-mail from <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matthew_Rycroft">Matthew Rycroft</a>, dated <phrase class="date" code="2002-09-19">19 September 2002</phrase>:</p> <p class="indent" pid=".833.0/22">"<a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ann_Taylor">Ann Taylor</a> read the draft dossier this morning and passed on some detailed comments to John Scarlett. She has just rung me to underline the following points. The dossier should more explicitly refer back to the end of the Gulf war, the cessation of hostilities agreement and the demands of Iraq arising from the UNCR then. This is a baseline that people will understand. The dossier itself needs to come across as an impartial professional assessment of the threat. The political policy questions of the response to the threat need to be separate. The <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PM">PM</a>'s statement to the House should make this distinction. The hardest questions in the debate, not fully answered by the dossier, remain why now and why Saddam. The PM should take these on in his statement to undercut critics."</p> <p pid=".833.0/23">The strongest defence of what I said about <a href="/mp/?m=1103" title="Our page on Michael Mates - 'the right hon. Member for Dewsbury came from the hon. Member for East Hampshire (Mr. Mates)'">Mr. Mates</a>, who has been appointed to the committee. I do not hold out much hope for the committee. As I have said, many lawyers who have looked at the conclusions of the first inquiry believe it is flawed.</p>            </div>

                                  <div class="debate-speech__content">                <p pid=".836.7/1">I doubt whether my constituents, along with most people in this country, begin to understand the press and media reaction to <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lord_Hutton">Lord Hutton</a>'s report in the last week. For weeks they had been told that Lord Hutton's findings would be the nemesis of the <a href="/glossary/?gl=264" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prime_Minister_of_the_United_Ki ngdom" class="glossary">Prime Minister</a> and the <a href="/glossary/?gl=23" title="Secretary of State was originally the title given to the two officials who..." class="glossary">Secretary of State</a> for Defence. They were told <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andrew_Gilligan">Andrew Gilligan</a>'s story&#8212;that the September 2002 dossier had been changed not by intelligence experts, but by the Government, to include a claim that Iraq's chemical and biological weapons could be deployed within 45 minutes. Furthermore, they were told that the Government knew that claim to be false, but included it to persuade people to support an invasion of Iraq.</p> <p pid=".836.7/2">Except for a charge of war crimes, it is difficult to imagine a more serious charge against a Government. The charge had added weight by being broadcast by the BBC with its worldwide reputation for accuracy and independence. Now we have Lord Hutton's report, based on evidence presented in public and closely argued, which says that the whole of that allegation was false and that the Government did not falsify the September 2002 dossier.</p> <p pid=".836.7/3">Collective media judgment on the issue was woefully wrong. Rather than admit that, however, there has been a week of unsupported denunciation of the <a href="/glossary/?gl=7" title="http://www.the-hutton-inquiry.org.uk/content/report/" class="glossary">Hutton report</a> in a press tantrum of petulance, malice, and self-indulgent irrationality. One aspect of the smokescreen is to pretend that Lord Hutton is a creature of the establishment who was bound to come down in favour of the Government&#8212;a sneering assertion, again unsupported by any evidence.</p> <p pid=".836.7/4">Lord Hutton has a record of judicial independence of which he and this country can be justly proud. In 1992, a republican prisoner, <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patrick_Nash">Patrick Nash</a>, was accused of attempting to murder four of Lord Hutton's fellow judges in Northern Ireland. Lord Hutton acquitted him, making it clear he did not believe the police evidence against the prisoner. That is the man who has explicitly and by innuendo been dubbed an establishment stooge during the past week. No doubt the detractors would have discovered a man of entirely different character if he had come to the conclusion that they wanted.</p> <p pid=".836.7/5">Another distraction, attempted by <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jeremy_Paxman">Jeremy Paxman</a> on "Newsnight", has been to say, "But we haven't discovered weapons of mass destruction in Iraq and Lord Hutton has said nothing about the reason for our going to war". Neither issue lay within the terms of the inquiry; neither related to the charge of falsification by the Government, nor to Dr. Kelly's death.</p> <p pid=".836.7/6">Both the chairman and the director-general of the BBC have justified themselves by saying that they were defending the independence of BBC reporting. I do not know what pressure was put on them during the Iraq war, but that was never the issue. The case was that a reporter walked in with a story from a single source, which defamed and was capable of wrecking the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/British_Government">British Government</a> and nobody bothered to check it before or after it was broadcast.</p> <p pid=".836.7/7">Knowing the significance of the controversy, the BBC governors did not examine any primary evidence. They reproduced the bunker mentality of the chairman and director-general in deciding that their prime responsibility was to defend the independence of the BBC, even at the risk of rallying round an odious lie. It is the BBC's corporate judgment that is at issue, not its right of independence from the Government.</p> <p pid=".836.7/8">Sadly, I believe that the reaction to Lord Hutton's inquiry, both before and after publication of his report, reflects a malaise in British journalism, and in the media generally. That malaise is the origin of the BBC's performance in this affair. It says that facts and evidence should not get in the way of a good story, and that it is perfectly all right to impugn the integrity of anyone&#8212;the Prime <a href="/glossary/?gl=35" title="Ministers make up the Government and almost all are members of the House of..." class="glossary">Minister</a>, Lord Hutton, or people dragged into the tabloid limelight&#8212;if that promotes a good story.</p> <p pid=".836.7/9">The same malaise is also evident in the attitude of many journalists with ambitions to be the next Woodward or Bernstein. They are ready to expose the corruption and dishonesty that is assumed to prevail among politicians and officials in both national Government and local government. If lying and corruption are assumed to be endemic, there is no need to be too meticulous about evidence or fairness. The end exposure justifies the means.</p>            </div>

However, Mr. Liddle is not a drunk in a bar at midnight. He is the former editor of the "Today" programme who hired <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andrew_Gilligan">Andrew Gilligan</a> as part of a policy of actively making the news rather than reporting it. He has certainly done that now.</p> <p pid=".838.4/2">Last week brought no distinction to British journalism generally, but mention has been made already of the article by <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andrew_Gowers">Andrew Gowers</a>, the editor of the <i><a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Financial_Times">Financial Times</a>.</i> It appeared in Saturday's edition of the newspaper, and is a noble exception for its objectivity and concern. I echo his cry:</p> <p class="indent" pid=".838.4/3">"Let this dreadful misadventure then serve as a wake-up call for all journalists."</p> <p pid=".838.4/4">The lifeblood of our democracy is accurate and objective information, from which people can draw their own conclusions. Yes, opinions should be presented in the media to aid debate, but it should be clear that that is what they are. To have false information posing as truth, and opinion masquerading as fact, ultimately corrodes confidence in democracy itself.</p> <p pid=".838.4/5">The <a href="/glossary/?gl=7" title="http://www.the-hutton-inquiry.org.uk/content/report/" class="glossary">Hutton report</a> is not just a warning to the BBC; it also warns of a culture and style that permeate most of journalism, and the media. To protect democracy, there must be a better code of ethics, and a framework of principles within which journalism and the media operate. If we can learn that lesson from this affair, good will come of it, and the BBC can return to being the standard bearer of truth and independence, quickly and unassailably.</p>            </div>

The first of those lessons comes from the information given to the House and which decided it that we were willing to go to war. I voted against that, but I did so on the important evidence that I was given. I hope that in the investigation we shall discover answers to three questions that are important for the way that this Government, or any Government, work.</p> <p pid=".839.0/3">First, why did no one ask about the nature of the weapons of mass destruction? Why did no one ask whether they were battlefield weapons? From my ministerial experience, I cannot understand why that interlocution did not apparently take place until so much later on.</p> <p pid=".839.0/4">Secondly, why did the <a href="/glossary/?gl=264" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prime_Minister_of_the_United_Ki ngdom" class="glossary">Prime Minister</a> not ask about the nature of the chemical weapons that had been talked about? How far had they already degenerated?</p> <p pid=".839.0/5">The third question is perhaps the most important. In a Government who are known constantly to urge the press and the BBC to correct their mistakes, why did no one press the newspapers to correct what they knew to be untrue&#8212;the headlines that suggested that the 45 minute claim referred to the sort of weapons that most of us thought threatened immediately and directly the great capitals of, at least, the middle east and, many thought, even of Europe?</p> <p pid=".839.0/6">For many of us from a particular tradition, the WMD issue is so important because, whatever the legalities, we believe that only it could have made the war a just one. It was because I did not believe in the existence of WMD that I could not support the war; I do not believe that the definition of a just war allows a pre-emptive strike unless there is an immediate and direct threat. I ask the Government to be clear about that, because the House needs that information if it is to make a judgment on an issue that is, in this case, also a moral one, on which the Prime <a href="/glossary/?gl=35" title="Ministers make up the Government and almost all are members of the House of..." class="glossary">Minister</a>'s moral judgment is opposed by every major leader of moral thought. That is a matter of importance and the Prime Minister failed to give the House the information we needed.</p>            </div>

                                  <div class="debate-speech__content">                <p pid=".840.1/1">That is the logic of my view. We would not be threatened and there would not have been an unjust war.</p> <p pid=".840.1/2">The Government must take seriously the real question that needs to be asked: why did that entirely untruthful allegation about them&#8212;the hateful lie to which the <a href="/glossary/?gl=264" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prime_Minister_of_the_United_Ki ngdom" class="glossary">Prime Minister</a> referred&#8212;immediately take legs? Why did people believe it so widely? There are two points for the Government to answer.</p> <p pid=".840.1/3">First, they must recognise that there was, by then, a widespread view that they were not always as careful with truth as they ought to be. They were warned about that much earlier on, in an article of considerable depth written by <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matthew_Parris">Matthew Parris</a>&#8212;a columnist normally known for his humour. In <i><a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Spectator">The Spectator</a></i> of <phrase class="date" code="1999-10-30">30 October 1999</phrase>, he said:</p> <p class="indent" pid=".840.1/4">"There will come a point in any prime <a href="/glossary/?gl=35" title="Ministers make up the Government and almost all are members of the House of..." class="glossary">minister</a>'s career when he needs to be able to say 'trust me' in circumstances where he can offer no better reason to do so than our own confidence in his trustworthiness. It is that belief in the minds of the press . . . which is being quietly shot to pieces as Mr. Blair's apparently untroubled progress continues."</p> <p pid=".840.1/5">I submit that Bernie Ecclestone, Mr. Mittal, the Walmart meeting, the Sudanese aspirin factory, the Hindujas, the Berlusconi phone call, the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Queen_Mother">Queen Mother</a>'s funeral and that first dodgy dossier gave credence to that untruthful allegation.</p> <p pid=".840.1/6">The second thing of which the Government have to remind themselves is that they have adopted towards all the broadcast media, as well as the written media, a harassing attitude, whereby every day, very often every hour, someone from No. 10 Downing street is pressing for a change in what the broadcast media are saying. I believe that it is true to say that a senior member of the BBC staff spent almost 50 per cent. of his time dealing with the Government's regular complaints about this or that portrayal. It is not therefore surprising that a proper judgment was not made about the importance of the attack in relation to Gilligan. It was one in a series of regular, daily attacks, but that does not justify the BBC.</p> <p pid=".840.1/7">I have been more critical of the BBC than most, but I will not take it from <a href="/mp/?m=1009" title="Our page on Gerald Kaufman - 'the right hon. Member for Manchester, Gorton (Mr. Kaufman)'">Mr. Kaufman</a>. When I was able to show that the BBC had produced a film in which it had spliced in other material on more than a dozen occasions to make a wholly wrong, wholly fallacious attack, which it had to withdraw in the end, but only at the gates of the court, one of the people who refused to support that battle, who was most offensive and in whom the milk of human kindness was least to be found was the right hon. Member for <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manchester,_Gorton">Manchester, Gorton</a>. His attacks on the BBC almost always occur when it is at variance with his own views, rather than with those of others. If the right hon. Gentleman is not here now, it is not my fault. He was here earlier and might have expected that comment because he asked for it.</p> <p pid=".840.1/8">I want to turn very quickly to <a href="/mp/?m=1092" title="Our page on Peter Mandelson - 'the right hon. Member for Hartlepool (Mr. Mandelson)'">Mr. Mandelson</a>, who is here. He became extremely angry when anyone suggested that there might have been some change in press officers because of their political inability to take their masters' orders. Well, I cannot prove any such change, but I believe that 18 took place in a very short period. There is no doubt that there is not a press officer in the world who does not believe that those changes were not entirely unconnected with a desire by an incoming Government to use the government mechanism to propagandise rather than inform. That does not excuse anything that the BBC did; it does not excuse anyone who now upholds an assertion that the Prime Minister lied, but it reminds us that people believed that lie because the Government have been dodgy about the truth for far too long and so people thought it likely.</p> <p pid=".840.1/9">The reason why the BBC failed to investigate properly is not acceptable or excusable&#8212;no one should excuse it&#8212;but the reason lies more in the way that the Government have treated the BBC, harassed its journalists and tried to ensure that the news that is put over to the people is the news as they would like it, with the headlines that they desire. It is that which made the difference, and it is that which the Prime Minister should think about.</p>            </div>

A fundamental review of the Osmotherly rules is needed to give <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Select_Committees">Select Committees</a> access to information that inquiries can ask for and get as a matter of routine.</p> <p pid=".841.2/6">The other thing that needs to be looked at is No. 10 and how it works. It is the classic paperless office&#8212;no notes of meetings were taken. It is astonishing that, over a two-week period, three written records were taken for up to 17 meetings a day. Phone calls and key decisions made over the phone were not recorded. Permanent secretaries, the top civil servants&#8212;belatedly doing now what they should have done then&#8212;are apparently insisting that key meetings, at which key decisions are taken, are properly minuted. Lord Hutton could follow the paper trail as far as the BBC was concerned, but there was no paper trail to follow in respect of what happened in No. 10&#8212;it all emerged from the evidence that was given during the <a href="/glossary/?gl=17" title="http://www.the-hutton-inquiry.org.uk/" class="glossary">Hutton inquiry</a>.</p> <p pid=".841.2/7">Hutton also brought out other facts that would have been buried. I refer my colleagues to an article by <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lord_Alexander">Lord Alexander</a>, the chairman of Justice&#8212;the British section of the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Commission_of_Jurists">International Commission of Jurists</a>&#8212;that appeared in Monday's <i><a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Financial_Times">Financial Times</a></i>, which chronologises and charts dossier changes, including key phrases that were taken out of the dossier in order to influence public opinion.</p> <p pid=".841.2/8">I am pleased that the Prime Minister, I think, told the House today that the new committee of inquiry will have sight of the whole, unexpurgated version of the legal advice that gave the legal basis for the Government to go to war. That is marvellous.</p> <p pid=".841.2/9">There are less satisfactory aspects of Hutton, of course, although I do not have time to go into them. Primarily, the focus was too narrow. When people give evidence to an inquiry that takes the judge outside his terms of reference, surely, in the interests of truth and justice, he should add a little footnote saying, "This is something that should be followed up." Yet Lord Hutton said that it was unnecessary for him to resolve the differences between the evidence that was given by my right hon. Friend the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secretary_of_State_for_Defence">Secretary of State for Defence</a> and <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alastair_Campbell">Alastair Campbell</a>, without inviting anyone else to pursue such matters.</p> <p pid=".841.2/10">I want to finish on the question of the BBC. I sit, sometimes biting my lip, behind my right hon. Friend <a href="/mp/?m=1009" title="Our page on Gerald Kaufman - 'the Member for Manchester, Gorton (Mr. Kaufman)'">Mr. Kaufman</a>, who is always dripping venom about the BBC, and cannot consider it objectively. He did so again today. <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_BBC">The BBC</a> has a programme complaints unit, and it is a great mystery to me why Alastair Campbell did not take that route. His complaint would have gone to <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greg_Dyke">Greg Dyke</a> and the BBC governors. <i>[Interruption.]</i> I invite my right hon. Friend the Member for Carrick, Cumnock and <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doon_Valley">Doon Valley</a> not to heckle me, because this is an important issue that goes to the heart of what we do&#8212;it is about truth and how people outside <a href="/glossary/?gl=239" title="The House of Commons." class="glossary">this place</a> perceive us. If we take on the BBC, we will be the losers, because those people believe the BBC much more than they would ever believe the Government or Parliament.</p>            </div>

                                  <div class="debate-speech__content">                <p pid=".843.0/1">It is an honour to follow such a colourful speech by <a href="/mp/?m=1168" title="Our page on Gordon Prentice - 'the hon. Member for Pendle (Mr. Prentice)'">Mr. Prentice</a>.</p> <p pid=".843.0/2">I want to place on record my belief that <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lord_Hutton">Lord Hutton</a> is an independent, noble Lord of great experience who showed fine courage during his time in Northern Ireland, when he was under daily threat of death from paramilitaries. He should also take great credit for the innovative way in which he conducted the inquiry, including making evidence available on the internet within a few hours, or certainly within a day or so, of its being given.</p> <p pid=".843.0/3">As he formed his views from looking at that evidence, I formed mine from looking at the same evidence. I believe that the September 2002 dossier was sexed up, and that Lord Hutton got that wrong. Dr. Kelly's death took place in the context of his involvement in <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andrew_Gilligan">Andrew Gilligan</a>'s allegation that the Government selectively used intelligence to present a better case for war in Iraq, especially in terms of weapons of mass destruction. The evidence illustrates that the basis of those allegations, for which Andrew Gilligan used Dr. Kelly, was correct. After 10 months of searching, no weapons of mass destruction have been found. As I said four months ago, it is still possible that silo doors may finally slide open, or a cave may be opened up, and shiny missiles will be rolled out to prove what we were told, and pleaded with to believe, last March, which was patently incorrect.</p> <p pid=".843.0/4">I want to echo what the hon. Member for Pendle said about innocent deaths in Iraq. It is too rarely mentioned in this House that to date more than 500 coalition troops have died, more than 8,500 innocent civilians have died, and more than 23,000 have been horribly maimed in a needless war. When I say that about 8,000 innocent civilians have died, that is the equivalent of killing 160 coachloads of men, women and children. To illustrate the point further, during the war I read the story of Mrs. Awaid, who lost most of her family as a result of allied bombing. I remember the photograph of her daughter, Sarah Awaid, a little girl of six; she was about the same age as my son at the time. She was dressed in a little tee-shirt on which there were 101 Dalmatians, but those black and white dogs were stained deep red because her body had been cut to ribbons by shrapnel. That is what war is about. I know that this House obtained through the great alliance of the Government and the <a href="/glossary/?gl=85" title="The Conservatives are a centre-right political party in the UK, founded in..." class="glossary">Conservatives</a> the vote that was needed to endorse the action, but it is clear that the decision was originally taken in Washington, in the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_House">White House</a>, and that the <a href="/glossary/?gl=264" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prime_Minister_of_the_United_Ki ngdom" class="glossary">Prime Minister</a> slavishly followed the President at the very time when he should have stood up to him.</p> <p pid=".843.0/5">That is what war is about. When we stack that up against what happened and what Lord Hutton found, we see that there is no comparison. We are talking about one broadcast at 6.7 in the morning on <phrase class="date" code="2004-05-29">29 May</phrase> in which Andrew Gilligan clearly made mistakes, embellished his comments and said over and above what he should have said on two counts&#8212;his suggestions that the Government probably knew that the 45-minute figure was wrong and that the reason the original draft had been changed in respect of weapons of mass destruction was that it came from one source. Yes, he was wrong, but he says that he was quoting what he believed his source was telling him. Do not get me wrong: I still think in the light of what followed that he deserved to be sacked. The way in which he influenced the Select Committee on Foreign Affairs and kept two records on his personal organiser meant that his position was untenable.</p>            </div>

                                  <div class="debate-speech__content">                <p pid=".844.1/1">The fact is that a journalist is fully entitled to investigate and quote sources to substantiate a very important point&#8212;in this case, the suggestion that this country had been misled and that Parliament had arguably been misled by a dossier that had been sexed up, as <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andrew_Gilligan">Andrew Gilligan</a> called it, and embellished, embroidered and so on.</p> <p pid=".844.1/2">In reading the evidence, I have looked at what else Andrew Gilligan said on the fateful broadcast of <phrase class="date" code="2004-05-29">29 May</phrase>:</p> <p class="indent" pid=".844.1/3">"The draft prepared for Mr. Blair by the intelligence agencies, actually didn't say very much more than was public knowledge already and <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Downing_Street">Downing Street</a> our source says, ordered a week before publication, it to be sexed up to be made more exciting and ordered more facts to be discovered."</p> <p pid=".844.1/4">He went on to say:</p> <p class="indent" pid=".844.1/5">"Our source says that the dossier as it was finally published made the intelligence services unhappy."</p> <p pid=".844.1/6">He was fundamentally right. When we look at the evidence on those two claims, we see that there is no disputing it. For example, let us consider the argument that the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joint_Intelligence_Committee">Joint Intelligence Committee</a> approved everything that the Government did. Let us accept that the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JIC">JIC</a> came up with a draft on <phrase class="date" code="2002-09-11">11 September 2002</phrase> and approved it, and it does have the experts who would have gathered all the evidence together. Surely it defies logic to suggest that when that document was challenged and Downing street officials requested that the wording be amended and subtly changed to help the case for war, it should then be changed into a second draft for <phrase class="date" code="2004-09-16">16 September</phrase>, and changed again on <phrase class="date" code="2004-09-19">19 September</phrase>.</p> <p pid=".844.1/7">If the JIC was in total control of the document, why was it amending it at the behest of politicians and officials in No. 10 Downing street? Let me give an example. The executive summary was changed so that, instead of saying that weapons of mass destruction could be deployed within 45 minutes of the order for their use being given, it said that they were deployable within 45 minutes. That is clearly a substantial change. <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alastair_Campbell">Alastair Campbell</a> had to admit in his evidence that he had suggested 16 changes. Dr. <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brian_Jones">Brian Jones</a>, who should know about these matters as the head of the nuclear, chemical and biological weapons section in the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MOD">MOD</a>'s defence intelligence and analysis staff, today simply reconfirmed what he has said previously. I quote from <i>The Independent</i>:</p> <p class="indent" pid=".844.1/8">"In my view, the expert intelligence analyses of the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DIS">DIS</a> were overruled in the preparation of the dossier back in September 2002, resulting in a presentation that was misleading about Iraq's capabilities."</p> <p pid=".844.1/9">So Andrew Gilligan was right. The intelligence services were unhappy. The <a href="/glossary/?gl=264" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prime_Minister_of_the_United_Ki ngdom" class="glossary">Prime Minister</a> has claimed that that information was not passed on to his desk, although we will never know, as I doubt whether the Butler inquiry will be able to get to the bottom of the matter. That is why I fully endorse what has been said about the reasons why the Liberal Democrats would not support the Butler inquiry. I have a quote. It reads:</p> <p class="indent" pid=".844.1/10">"<a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Liberal_Democrats">The Liberal Democrats</a> are absolutely right to have nothing to do with this charade. The pity is that the Tories haven't taken the same robust view."</p> <p pid=".844.1/11">Those are not my words. They appear in today's editorial in the <i><a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Daily_Mail">Daily Mail</a></i>. That demonstrates the simple fact that most people have doubts about what will come out of such a private inquiry. <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tony_Cragg">Tony Cragg</a>, the former deputy chief of defence intelligence, has undermined the Government's case that there was nothing that made the intelligence services unhappy. Of course they were desperately unhappy, as <a href="/mp/?m=817" title="Our page on Robin Cook - 'the right hon. Member for Livingston (Mr. Cook)'">Mr. Cook</a> said.</p> <p pid=".844.1/12">I find all the Beeb bashing this afternoon despicable. We have the finest public service broadcaster in the world. We need it more than ever to hold to account a Government who have utterly failed the British people.</p>            </div>

                                  <div class="debate-speech__content">                <p pid=".845.0/1">Weapons of mass destruction are haunting the Government. I do not believe that the issue will be brought to rest until the big political questions are answered. There is little to suggest that <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lord_Butler">Lord Butler</a> will succeed in exorcising the phantom where three other inquiries have failed. Whatever is said in the House, the <a href="/glossary/?gl=37" title="The term &quot;majority&quot; is used in two ways in Parliament. Firstly a Government..." class="glossary">majority</a> of the public believe that <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lord_Hutton">Lord Hutton</a> forfeited his credibility by trying to lay all the blame on the BBC and none on the Government.</p> <p pid=".845.0/2">I do not know how the Butler inquiry can command greater confidence when the <a href="/glossary/?gl=264" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prime_Minister_of_the_United_Ki ngdom" class="glossary">Prime Minister</a> has already told us that the Government decision to go to war is out of bounds. He has put a man in charge of the inquiry whose background will equally incline him to exonerate the Government. Even the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intelligence_and_Security_Committee">Intelligence and Security Committee</a>, which backed the Government when it reported on September, was critical of the Government's assessment of weapons of mass destruction. I will remind the House of what the Committee said in its report. Referring to the September dossier, it said:</p> <p class="indent" pid=".845.0/3">"The use of the phrase 'continued to produce chemical and biological weapons' in the foreword and the absence of detail . . . could give the impression that Saddam was actively producing both chemical and biological weapons and significant amounts of agents. However, the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JIC">JIC</a> did not know what had been produced and in what quantities".</p> <p pid=".845.0/4">Secondly, the first draft of the Prime <a href="/glossary/?gl=35" title="Ministers make up the Government and almost all are members of the House of..." class="glossary">Minister</a>'s foreword shows that the Government recognised that the nature of the threat that Saddam posed was not directly to mainland UK. It was unfortunate that this point was removed from the published version and not highlighted elsewhere.</p> <p pid=".845.0/5"><a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Committee">The Committee</a> went on to say that the dossier was for public consumption and not for experienced readers of intelligence material. <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_45">The 45</a>-minute claim, which was included four times, was assessed to refer to battlefield chemical and biological munitions, which should have been highlighted. The omission was unhelpful to an understanding of this issue.</p> <p pid=".845.0/6">The Committee concluded:</p> <p class="indent" pid=".845.0/7">"We regard the initial failure by the MoD to disclose that some staff had put their concerns in writing to their line managers as unhelpful and potentially misleading."</p> <p pid=".845.0/8">One of these was <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brian_Jones">Brian Jones</a>, who made a formal complaint about it. Writing in today's edition of <i>The Independent</i> he traces in what I believe is convincing detail how he and his colleagues were overruled.</p> <p pid=".845.0/9">The public still want to know, and the House should demand that they be told, why the Government took this country into an illegal and unjustified war. Why was the Prime Minister so sure that Iraq had weapons of mass destruction when the weight of evidence did not merit such certainty? How can we be sure that the same pretext will not be used in future to take us to war again against Iraq, Korea or Syria?</p> <p pid=".845.0/10">The public think&#8212;rightly, in my view&#8212;that the Government are ducking and diving. That is hardly unreasonable in the circumstances. For months, and against all comers, the Prime Minister has been insisting that Iraq had weapons of mass destruction. Then, the day after <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_Bush">George Bush</a> decides that there will be an American inquiry, the Prime Minister calls for one in Britain. I have to say that it sent shivers down my spine when I heard the Prime Minister tell the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liaison_Committee">Liaison Committee</a> yesterday that whatever the outcome of the debate about weapons of mass destruction, he did not accept that it was wrong to remove Saddam Hussein. That is the beginning of an admission that weapons of mass destruction were a pretext, and the window-dressing for regime change. I believe that the new committee has already been judged in the court of public opinion, and only a full-scale inquiry, like the Scott inquiry into a previous Government's role in breaking the arms embargo, will satisfy public opinion. With that new committee, the Government are storing up problems for the future.</p> <p pid=".845.0/11">The decision to go to war was taken at a very high cost. Thousands of Iraqis lost their lives and many more were injured&#8212;and many continue to die and to be injured today. The <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anglo-American">Anglo-American</a> occupation is almost universally unpopular, and now we see the Iraqis protesting at not being allowed to vote for their own Government. That is a far cry from what the Prime Minister said today, when he assured us that the face of post-war Iraq looked much better. I wish that we, as an occupying force, would start counting the number of dead Iraqis, including civilians, and the number of children who are injured or killed by cluster bombs. <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Prime_Minister">The Prime Minister</a> may have decided that he has given up on those of us who opposed the war, but every time I close my eyes I am determined to carry on opposing this illegal war, because I get a picture of little Ali, without any arms and without any family, and of thousands more children who have suffered. I certainly will not give up arguing that this was a bad war; we might stop the same happening somewhere else.</p> <p pid=".845.0/12">The <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carnegie_Endowment">Carnegie Endowment</a> report "<a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WMD_in_Iraq">WMD in Iraq</a>: Evidence and Implications", which was published a few weeks ago and may have contributed to <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/President_Bush">President Bush</a>'s decision to set up an inquiry, concluded that the war on Iraq was not the best or the only option. It made wide-ranging recommendations about American policy and practice. For example, it revised the US's national security strategy to eliminate unilateral preventive war&#8212;that is, the Bush doctrine of going to war in the absence of an imminent threat.</p> <p pid=".845.0/13">The report proposed international action and said that the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UN_Secretary-General">UN Secretary-General</a> should commission a high-level analysis of the strengths and weaknesses of the weapons of mass destruction inspection process. I mentioned earlier a former UN weapons inspector, <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scott_Ritter">Scott Ritter</a>, who is coming to a conference that I am organising in March. He was quoted today in the <i><a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Daily_Mirror">Daily Mirror</a></i> and gave many examples of how false information was systematically spread in Britain.</p> <p pid=".845.0/14">If we are to learn anything from the WMD debacle, it should be, first, that a full-scale independent inquiry is the proper and only way to redeem the reputation of my Government and the Labour party, and we should have one before it is too late. Secondly, the task of overseeing weapons inspections should be returned to the UN, with <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kofi_Annan">Kofi Annan</a> in charge of overhauling those procedures, so that in future we do not go to war on false pretences. Unlike the Prime Minister, I believe that the world is a far less safe place because we took this country into an illegal war.</p>            </div>

I did not do so joyfully, and I do not suppose that any Member of this House did, but I believed that it was the lesser of two evils and that it was the right decision. My view was swayed not by any dossier but rather by the certain knowledge of a repressive and bestial regime that had for decades subjugated its own people with torture, murder and rapine of Hitlerian proportions. That is why I voted without any qualms to support the <a href="/glossary/?gl=264" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prime_Minister_of_the_United_Ki ngdom" class="glossary">Prime Minister</a>. He made on that day a speech of surpassing elegance and conviction, which will go down as one of the great speeches of the last 10 or 20 years in this House. I believed then, and I believe now, that he spoke in good faith, and because he believed that what he was saying was right.</p> <p pid=".847.0/3">I can pick many quarrels with the Prime <a href="/glossary/?gl=35" title="Ministers make up the Government and almost all are members of the House of..." class="glossary">Minister</a>. On many things, he is profoundly wrong. His treatment of our constitution has been cavalier in the extreme, but that is not what we are debating today and it is not the point. I was very glad that both he and my right hon. and learned Friend the <a href="/glossary/?gl=175" title="The &quot;Leader of the Opposition&quot; is head of &quot;Her Majesty's Official..." class="glossary">Leader of the Opposition</a> made such very good and persuasive speeches this afternoon, and I thought it right that the official <a href="/glossary/?gl=29" title="The Opposition are the political parties in the House of Commons other than..." class="glossary">Opposition</a> supported the Government in their decision last year.</p> <p pid=".847.0/4">I am saddened by the fact that there has been a little flaking off. Of course, I am not referring to those such as my right hon. Friend <a href="/mp/?m=929" title="Our page on John Gummer - 'the Member for Suffolk, Coastal (Mr. Gummer)'">Mr. Gummer</a> or my right hon. and learned Friend <a href="/mp/?m=802" title="Our page on Kenneth Clarke - 'the Member for Rushcliffe (Mr. Clarke)'">Mr. Clarke</a>, who have always been against the war, as has the hon. Member for Halifax. But the point is that whatever inquiry we have, whatever committee we set up and however we approach this issue, they are not going to be satisfied. We had a democratic vote in the most democratic assembly in the world, and we voted by a large <a href="/glossary/?gl=37" title="The term &quot;majority&quot; is used in two ways in Parliament. Firstly a Government..." class="glossary">majority</a> to take such action and to support the Government.</p> <p pid=".847.0/5">Of course, intelligence is an inexact science, as has been said many times in recent weeks. But it was appalling that the BBC should have allowed such stories to be peddled without checking their veracity. I am delighted that <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lord_Hutton">Lord Hutton</a> reported as he did. I came to, and aspired to come to, <a href="/glossary/?gl=239" title="The House of Commons." class="glossary">this place</a>&#8212;many Members on both sides of the House doubtless felt the same&#8212;because I believed in the essential integrity of British public life, and in the central place of the <a href="/glossary/?gl=192" title="The House of Commons is one of the houses of parliament. Here, elected MPs..." class="glossary">House of Commons</a> within it. To me, the <a href="/glossary/?gl=7" title="http://www.the-hutton-inquiry.org.uk/content/report/" class="glossary">Hutton report</a> is a vindication of both those beliefs. There are many things about the culture of spin that I do not like, and to some degree the Government are the architects of their own misfortunes, as my right hon. Friend the Member for Suffolk, Coastal said. But the essential point is whether the Prime Minister acted in good faith last year, and the unequivocal answer in Hutton is yes.</p> <p pid=".847.0/6">People say that this report is a whitewash merely because it has not come out with what they call a balanced judgment. But as my right hon. Friend <a href="/mp/?m=1289" title="Our page on David Trimble - 'the Member for Upper Bann (Mr. Trimble)'">Mr. Trimble</a> said, Lord Hutton is a judge of great eminence. Indeed, he was spoken of as being perhaps the best judge of all, and certainly the best person to conduct this inquiry. He reached an emphatic verdict: he said that certain people were guilty of certain things, and that others were innocent of the charges made against them.

But once they realised that he was taking a certain line, they took a different one themselves. <i>[Interruption.]</i> As one of my colleagues mutters from a <a href="/glossary/?gl=128" title="In the process of debate, members of parliament need to stand up in order..." class="glossary">sedentary position</a>, "They would, wouldn't they?"</p> <p pid=".849.1/2">We have a great deal to be thankful for in this country. We can be thankful that we have this Parliament, where we can have debates with honest differences of opinion and can refer to our own Committees. I believe that the <a href="/glossary/?gl=264" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prime_Minister_of_the_United_Ki ngdom" class="glossary">Prime Minister</a> was right. I have argued against special inquiries before. My colleagues on the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foreign_Affairs_Committee">Foreign Affairs Committee</a> know that I had real misgivings about the inquiry, and made my position plain both in the Committee and on the Floor of the House. I thought that the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intelligence_and_Security_Committee">Intelligence and Security Committee</a> was the right body to deal with this, and I wish it had done, but because that was clearly not acceptable to my right hon. and learned Friend the <a href="/glossary/?gl=175" title="The &quot;Leader of the Opposition&quot; is head of &quot;Her Majesty's Official..." class="glossary">Leader of the Opposition</a>, for perfectly honourable reasons, the Prime <a href="/glossary/?gl=35" title="Ministers make up the Government and almost all are members of the House of..." class="glossary">Minister</a> has gone down a different road. One person who was unrelievedly pleased about this was of course my newly right hon. Friend <a href="/mp/?m=1103" title="Our page on Michael Mates - 'the Member for East Hampshire (Mr. Mates)'">Mr. Mates</a>, whom we all congratulate and wish success.</p> <p pid=".849.1/3">Although I have faith in those five people, I am sorry that there is not a Liberal Democrat representative, and the party has not covered itself in glory in this respect. When the Butler committee reports, let us read its findings extremely carefully. Let us not prejudge. We must accept that it would be wrong for it to express a view on whether it was right or wrong to go to war. That is not within its terms of reference, nor should it be.</p> <p pid=".849.1/4">This morning I was talking to a Russian-speaking friend, who told me about a programme on Iraq that was apparently screened on Russian television last night. The verdict was that if "we"&#8212;that is, the Russians&#8212;had said that there were weapons of mass destruction in Iraq, there would have been. We have a great deal to be thankful for: the openness, honesty and transparency of both the British and American Governments, who have not sought to hide the facts from us. <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Prime_Minister">The Prime Minister</a> believed genuinely, as many of us believed, that the weapons would be there. We all know that they were there in the past and we saw the destruction that was wrought with them, but even if they are not there now, that does not in my view undermine the essential validity of the case against Iraq. I believe that both that and the <a href="/glossary/?gl=7" title="http://www.the-hutton-inquiry.org.uk/content/report/" class="glossary">Hutton report</a> should allow us to draw a line under the fractiousness that has rather spoiled the cross-party accord, and now move on and look forward to the Butler committee's report.</p>            </div>

                                  <div class="debate-speech__content">                <p pid=".850.0/1"><a href="/mp/?m=820" title="Our page on Patrick Cormack - 'The hon. Member for South Staffordshire (Sir Patrick Cormack)'">Sir Patrick Cormack</a> spoke with great thoughtfulness and wisdom, and I suspect that his views command considerable support across the House.</p> <p pid=".850.0/2">I want to speak chiefly about the BBC, not because I am a Beeb-basher, but because I am a long-standing supporter of the BBC who once worked for it. I stress at the outset that we can all celebrate the fact that the <a href="/glossary/?gl=7" title="http://www.the-hutton-inquiry.org.uk/content/report/" class="glossary">Hutton report</a> did not reveal rotten politics or wicked politicians, and did not produce any political scalps. Thank goodness we still live in a country where these matters are determined on the basis of facts, evidence and judgments reached by learned people such as <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lord_Hutton">Lord Hutton</a>, rather than on the basis of media show trials and kangaroo courts. If it were otherwise, it would be like living in a reverse police state, presided over by a clutch of newspaper editors.</p> <p pid=".850.0/3">I am very pleased indeed that my right hon. Friend the <a href="/glossary/?gl=23" title="Secretary of State was originally the title given to the two officials who..." class="glossary">Secretary of State</a> for Defence survived the scalp hunting. It was entirely right that he should do so. However, just because the Government were not criticised by Lord Hutton, it does not mean that they are above criticism or above at least some reflection about certain aspects of what happened. I thought that <a href="/mp/?m=1248" title="Our page on John Stanley - 'the right hon. Member for Tonbridge and Malling (Sir John Stanley)'">Sir John Stanley</a> made an important point in the early part of his speech about the presentational tensions and issues that arise when intelligence is put into the public domain. As the phenomenon of terrorism grows, the pressure will grow from the public and the media to put more, not less, classified information and intelligence into the public domain. The Government must carefully consider their relationship with the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joint_Intelligence_Committee">Joint Intelligence Committee</a>.</p> <p pid=".850.0/4">Dr. Kelly's unauthorised media contact led to his unwelcome exposure, but it is worth bearing in mind that he had previously been employed routinely to brief journalists when it suited his line managers for him to do so. He probably mistook the type and quality of journalist with whom he was dealing when he met <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andrew_Gilligan">Andrew Gilligan</a>, and he subsequently over-spoke, but the far worse crime was not what Dr. Kelly said but what Andrew Gilligan misrepresented him as saying&#8212;what some have described since as the "detail of the story". <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rod_Liddle">Rod Liddle</a>, not only the last man left in the bar at midnight but the editor of the "Today" programme who employed Andrew Gilligan, said:</p> <p class="indent" pid=".850.0/5">"Andrew gets great stories and some of them are even true".</p> <p pid=".850.0/6">That brings me to the BBC. I want to take up the points made by the right hon. Members for Berwick-upon-Tweed (Mr. Beith) and for <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Upper_Bann">Upper Bann</a> (Mr. Trimble) about the "Today" programme. Andrew Gilligan may well have been at fault and may even have been dishonest, but his words were not the only ones, or even the main ones, to mislead listeners on that day. At 7.32 am, <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Humphrys">John Humphrys</a> introduced another two-way by saying,</p> <p class="indent" pid=".850.0/7">"our defence correspondent Andrew Gilligan has found evidence that the Government's dossier on Iraq that was produced last September was cobbled together at the last minute with some unconfirmed material that had not been approved by the security services".</p> <p pid=".850.0/8">I do not know whether John Humphrys's remarks were scripted and what editorial controls he is subject to, but his statement contains five errors of fact. Either the editorial system in that programme is faulty or the judgment of the people operating it is faulty. Either way, something or somebody should be put right.</p>            </div>

For me, the greater culpability than the original story&#8212;by the way, the subject was legitimate&#8212;was the failure to correct it. It is true that by that time the BBC had found itself in a power struggle, and no doubt that helped to scramble its collective mind. However, the BBC management defended what they knew to be absolutely indefensible.</p> <p pid=".851.2/2"><a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greg_Dyke">Greg Dyke</a> has rightly left the BBC because he was at the centre of its mishandling the matter. Mr. Dyke was clearly an inspiring and popular leader who got some big decisions right during his time at the corporation. He was popular because he adopted an "I believe in you" empowering style of leadership. The downside of "I believe in you" was a reluctance to investigate complaints. He devolved power in a way we would like to see matched in many other public sector organisations; the trouble is that he devolved his judgment as well, with the sorry consequences spelled out by <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lord_Hutton">Lord Hutton</a>.</p> <p pid=".851.2/3">The big question is: where does the BBC go from here? I suggest, first, that the distinction be made between independence from the Government, which is of course sacred, and mindless oppositionism to the Government, which is best left to the press. I do not only mean this Government: I mean all Governments. I would like to see the BBC showing greater self-confidence in separating itself from the herd of the press.</p> <p pid=".851.2/4">Secondly, the BBC can comfort itself with the knowledge that it remains the world's premier public service broadcasting organisation, and that can and should be strengthened by charter review.</p> <p pid=".851.2/5">Thirdly, I would like to see the BBC set a different standard in the reporting of politics, rather than getting into the sandpit with the rest. We are witnessing not only a souring but a poisoning of the relationship between the media and politics, which did not start in this Government's time. It behoves us all&#8212;BBC, other media and politicians&#8212;to do what we can to put that right.</p>            </div>

                                  <div class="debate-speech__content">                <p pid=".851.3/1">There is a conspiracy in British public life. Politics needs the media as much as the media needs politics. They feed each other in an alliance that shapes the governance of this country, and has done so for decades. Occasionally, the innocent, such as Dr. Kelly, get caught in the crossfire. Nothing prepared us for the drama that stole the summer of 2003. Stories that Britain had gone to war on a false prospectus had been circulating for months. None had produced any response from the Government, until the Gilligan piece of <phrase class="date" code="2004-05-29">29 May</phrase>.</p> <p pid=".851.3/2">I agree with my hon. Friend <a href="/mp/?m=999" title="Our page on Boris Johnson - 'the Member for Henley (Mr. Johnson)'">Mr. Johnson</a> that the main thrust of Gilligan's story has to a large extent been found to be true. It was a scoop in true journalistic style, marred by a single sentence that could not be corroborated. But the suggestion that lit the fuse was the assertion that Campbell had sexed up the September dossier. It produced a nuclear reaction. As the <a href="/glossary/?gl=264" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prime_Minister_of_the_United_Ki ngdom" class="glossary">Prime Minister</a>'s press officer bulldozed his way through the Committee Corridors and television studios, Dr. <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Kelly">David Kelly</a> watched and owned up. Three weeks later, he was dead. Seven months later, the chairman and director general of the BBC have resigned. Messrs. Campbell, Powell, Hoon and Blair are found to be humble servants of the people, just doing their every day job. The scale of the Government's triumph was compounded by the smugness of Mr. Campbell giving a press conference of vindication. His aim to have a</p> <p class="indent" pid=".851.3/3">"win, not a messy draw" was fulfilled.</p> <p pid=".851.3/5">I have read the same evidence as <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lord_Hutton">Lord Hutton</a>, and how he reached the conclusions he did, only he knows. To remove phrases from the September dossier that suggested that Saddam would only use WMD if attacked looks like sexing it up to me, whichever of Lord Hutton's definitions is used. The unanswered questions remain, but they are all outside the new inquiry's brief. The premise on which this Parliament voted for war was flawed, exaggerated and deceptive.</p> <p pid=".851.3/6">We went to war because the Government argued that Saddam posed a "current and serious" threat to the middle east and the stability of the world. The Government said that uranium had been sought from Africa, implying development of nuclear weapons. Not even the CIA thinks that that is true. The Prime <a href="/glossary/?gl=35" title="Ministers make up the Government and almost all are members of the House of..." class="glossary">Minister</a> said that weapons of mass destruction would be ready within 45 minutes of an order to use them. We now find that that referred to</p> <p class="indent" pid=".851.3/7">"battlefield mortar shells or small calibre weaponry".</p> <p pid=".851.3/8">Those are not weapons that threatened the region or the stability of the world.</p> <p pid=".851.3/9">The four 45 minute assertions were downright inaccurate and rash statements that misled everyone who read the September 2002 dossier. In his diaries, <a href="/mp/?m=817" title="Our page on Robin Cook - 'the right hon. Member for Livingston (Mr. Cook)'">Mr. Cook</a>, who was a member of the <a href="/glossary/?gl=108" title="The cabinet is the group of twenty or so (and no more than 22) senior..." class="glossary">Cabinet</a> at the time, said that not even the Prime Minister believed the assertion by the time of the debate and vote on <phrase class="date" code="2004-03-18">18 March</phrase>. After my <a href="/glossary/?gl=39" title="An intervention is when the MP making a speech is interrupted by another MP..." class="glossary">intervention</a> in the Prime Minister's speech today, we know that he did not even know what weapons that claim referred to. Interestingly, the right hon. Member for Livingston suggested that the Prime Minister should check his records.</p>            </div>

I do not accept that mortar shells or small calibre weaponry would pose a threat to the region, the middle east or the stability of the world.</p> <p pid=".853.1/2">So why did the Government push their false prospectus? The reason is manifest. Had they come to this House and said that the United States had every intention of invading Iraq and finishing off the business of the 1991 Gulf war, the real question to consider would have been whether we were with or against them. The issue would have been clear, with the lessons of Suez learned and Britain's interests being seen to lie with the United States. The Government would not, or could not, deploy that argument for the simple reason that they knew that they could not carry their own <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Back_Benchers">Back Benchers</a> with them. That is why they had to exaggerate and spin to get their arguments through the House. They would have got away with that, had it not been for a conversation between Dr. Kelly and Mr. Gilligan of the BBC.</p> <p pid=".853.1/3">The damage has been immense. Never before has this country gone to war on the strength of intelligence reports alone, and I suspect that it never will again. It was critical that the intelligence services got it right. The subconscious pressures on them were immense, but the chairman of the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joint_Intelligence_Committee">Joint Intelligence Committee</a> accepted responsibility for the September dossier, and he must explain what went wrong and justify it to the Butler committee. What on earth was Mr. Scarlett doing drafting the famous press release at No. 10 on the day that Dr. Kelly was named? The intelligence services were subverted for political purposes.</p> <p pid=".853.1/4">Then there is the dodgy dossier, the cut-and-paste job. It was presented to Parliament as further intelligence underpinned by the integrity of our intelligence services. What breathtaking hypocrisy. It turned out to be nothing more than Government propaganda. Why is it that the <a href="/glossary/?gl=264" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prime_Minister_of_the_United_Ki ngdom" class="glossary">Prime Minister</a> gets away with that story with a casual "sorry" from his press office, when the carnage caused to the BBC by one sentence from a reporter&#8212;which, ironically, may yet prove to have more than a grain of truth&#8212;brings Britain's most popular public institution to its knees? But what else would one expect from a Government who act as if they were in an episode of "<a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_West_Wing">The West Wing</a>", making instant decisions in corridors without any minutes being taken?</p> <p pid=".853.1/5">Whatever side of the political spectrum we are on, we know that the public must have trust in the Government as an institution. The alternative is cynicism and anarchy. This affair boils down to integrity and honesty. In the dark days of the second world war, when Britain faced a genuine "current and serious threat", the country turned to Churchill. He knew that if the people of Britain were to trust him, he had to be nothing but honest with them. He stood at that <a href="/glossary/?gl=171" title="If you've ever seen inside the Commons, you'll notice a large table in the..." class="glossary">Dispatch Box</a> and said:</p> <p class="indent" pid=".853.1/6">"I have nothing to offer but blood, toil, tears and sweat."&#8212;[<a href="/search/?pop=1&s=date:19400513+column:1502+section:debates"><i>Hansard</i>, 13 May 1940; Vol. 360, c. 1502</a>.]</p> <p pid=".853.1/7">All we have had from this Government during the past six months has been nervous perspiration, crocodile tears and someone else's blood. Yet when the <a href="/glossary/?gl=175" title="The &quot;Leader of the Opposition&quot; is head of &quot;Her Majesty's Official..." class="glossary">Leader of the Opposition</a> rose to speak here in the mother of Parliaments&#8212;famed for its defence of freedom and free speech&#8212;they booed, hissed and shouted him down.

                                  <div class="debate-speech__content">                <p pid=".854.0/1">In the past week, the Government, quite understandably, must have felt as though all their Christmases had come at once. They had a report from <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lord_Hutton">Lord Hutton</a> that seemed to exceed their wildest dreams, but the cautionary note is that that does not seem to resonate with the British people, at least not yet. All the polls suggest that more people still, rightly or wrongly, believe the BBC than believe the Government.</p> <p pid=".854.0/2">We should remember that the whole business surrounding the <a href="/glossary/?gl=17" title="http://www.the-hutton-inquiry.org.uk/" class="glossary">Hutton inquiry</a> was a diversion born of a diversion. When <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alastair_Campbell">Alastair Campbell</a> went into the Select Committee on Foreign Affairs, it was considering the events that led up to the declaration of war on Iraq. In my view, he quite deliberately and successfully set out to divert that Committee, which ended up with the sad loss of Dr. Kelly and all the events that have stemmed from that. Campbell succeeded in avoiding, at least up to a point, the central issue of why we went to war in the first place.</p> <p pid=".854.0/3">Something came to my mind earlier when I was listening to <a href="/mp/?m=1016" title="Our page on Charles Kennedy - 'the right hon. Member for Ross, Skye and Inverness, West (Mr. Kennedy)'">Mr. Kennedy</a>. I once came across a little town in the south-west of the United States called Truth or Consequences. That sounds like a board game, and I have often wondered what the town did to deserve that name, but the phrase "truth or consequences" is very pregnant. Out of the truth, consequences are born for the Government.</p> <p pid=".854.0/4">I would like to contextualise, in accord with what the <a href="/glossary/?gl=264" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prime_Minister_of_the_United_Ki ngdom" class="glossary">Prime Minister</a> said this afternoon, a debate that is ostensibly on Lord Hutton's report. When we have truth, we build up a trust. The corollary of that is that, when we have less than the full truth, it can lead to disbelief and cynicism, and often to total distrust. A great problem faces the Government on this issue. This reminds me of the lament of the psalmist who wrote:</p> <p class="indent" pid=".854.0/5">"O put not your trust in princes, nor in any child of man: for there is no help in them."</p> <p pid=".854.0/6">There is no help to be had in satisfying the misgivings of people in this country by reading or listening to the debate on the <a href="/glossary/?gl=7" title="http://www.the-hutton-inquiry.org.uk/content/report/" class="glossary">Hutton report</a>.</p> <p pid=".854.0/7">I mentioned contextualising. I would just like to flag up a few of the confusions that arose before Lord Hutton's deliberations, and which I assume will go on into the next round, the Butler committee. People do not have to mislead consciously or deliberately to create a totally false impression of reality. We were told in recent days, for example, that everyone believed that Saddam Hussein had weapons of mass destruction. There is a point to be made here about the definition of "weapons of mass destruction". My recollection of the definition&#8212;I think that this is true&#8212;is that the term related mainly to nuclear weaponry and not, initially, to biological or chemical weaponry. That is certainly the case. There was a transposition over time to suit political objectives, both in the United States and here, in terms of the usage of that phrase.</p> <p pid=".854.0/8">The idea that all the intelligence services have hitherto miraculously believed in the existence of weapons of mass destruction is simply not the case. An example involves the much maligned French. The director of the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DST">DST</a>, one of the French security services, Pierre de Bousquet de Florian, wrote openly in <i><a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Le_Monde">Le Monde</a></i> on <phrase class="date" code="2004-07-26">26 July</phrase>. He was asked certain questions and they were quite open. <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Americans">The Americans</a> are also very open; <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_Tenet">George Tenet</a> is open, for example. I do not think that we get such chances to ask such open questions. As we heard today, the committee could not ask <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Scarlett">John Scarlett</a> such questions. In France, those questions get into the newspapers.</p> <p pid=".854.0/9">Pierre de Bousquet de Florian was asked whether the DST shared the analysis of the American and British services on the links between Saddam Hussein's Iraq and al-Qaeda. He said no, and gave his reasons. He was then asked whether the same disagreement applied to the question of weapons of mass destruction, and was given the example of the affair involving uranium in Niger. His answer was no, and again he gave his reasons. When asked whether such weapons could be deployed within 45 minutes, as the British assessment claimed, he gave what we might think was a typically French response:</p> <p class="indent" pid=".854.0/10">"Well! Saddam Hussein being engaged in carrying out chemical, biological and nuclear programmes, that's a different matter. Here and there you will no doubt find initial attempts at carrying them out. But we have never had any indications of completed programmes that are ready to be used."</p> <p pid=".854.0/11">Uranium from Niger is an example.</p>            </div>

We have already disposed of weapons of mass destruction. I think that everybody, perhaps with the notable exception of the <a href="/glossary/?gl=264" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prime_Minister_of_the_United_Ki ngdom" class="glossary">Prime Minister</a>, is now convinced that they do not exist. Did Kamal Hussein tell the truth when he came across? Hon. Members might recall that he was Saddam Hussein's nephew. He did tell the truth to the intelligence services of this country and others. Presumably that is partly why Saddam Hussein had him murdered when he returned to Iraq. We did not get a full account of what he said, however. Apart from talking about the existence of the programmes in the 1980s and through to the beginning of the 1990s, he also said that he had been personally instrumental in instructing the Iraqi forces to destroy whatever stockpiles they had left after the 1991 war. Hon. Members might say, "Well, he would say that, and he died for it." But the reality is that he said it, yet we have heard only a partial account.</p> <p pid=".855.1/3">Another claim that is often made is that the UN inspectors were forced out. I have no better source to refer to on this than my right hon. Friend <a href="/mp/?m=817" title="Our page on Robin Cook - 'the Member for Livingston (Mr. Cook)'">Mr. Cook</a>, who told the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foreign_Affairs_Committee">Foreign Affairs Committee</a> that the coalition bombing forced them out, not the Iraqis. That was a deliberate policy move. We could go on to examine the September dossier, the links with al-Qaeda, or the allegations that <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/President_Chirac">President Chirac</a> was about to veto whatever came forward when we were battling over the second resolution. All of that is demonstrably untrue.</p> <p pid=".855.1/4">My contention is that we had a partial context, in which people formed opinions often on the basis of half-truth and omission, as much as anything that was positively said which people would take exception to.</p> <p pid=".855.1/5">We end up now with yet another committee coming up. It will be chaired by <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lord_Butler">Lord Butler</a>. How he views responding in such an inquiry is quoted in <a href="/glossary/?gl=90" title="An Early Day Motion (EDM) is a motion put down, or tabled, on the order..." class="glossary">early day motion</a> No. 540, as follows:</p> <p class="indent" pid=".855.1/6">"You have to be selective about the facts", he told the Scott inquiry. He went on:</p> <p class="indent" pid=".855.1/8">"The purpose . . . was to give an answer which itself was true. It did not give the full picture. It was half an answer".</p> <p pid=".855.1/9">I am mindful of past exercises by senior civil servants and the sophistry that they employ on behalf of their political masters. I do not know whether it is something that is imbued in them from birth or that is transplanted once they reach the heady heights of the First <a href="/glossary/?gl=43" title="The House of Commons votes by dividing. Those voting Aye (yes) to any..." class="glossary">Division</a>. All I know is that it does not lead the British public to feel more confident about arriving at the ultimate truth to the ultimate question.</p> <p pid=".855.1/10">But truth is where we came in, and truth, like every other object in this world, has its season and its time. The time for truth is now. The Government should not constrain the truth. They will rue the day that they have done so. I believe that a case is still maintained by Government that the truth cannot come out fully.</p>            </div>

                                  <div class="debate-speech__content">                <p pid=".856.0/1">As Mrs. Janice Kelly's <a href="/glossary/?gl=36" title="A Member of Parliament (MP) is elected by a particular area or constituency..." class="glossary">Member of Parliament</a>, I have naturally been in touch with her several times since the tragic event of last July. I have had no specific requests from her, but on her behalf and in the light of <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lord_Hutton">Lord Hutton</a>'s findings, I should like to press the <a href="/glossary/?gl=23" title="Secretary of State was originally the title given to the two officials who..." class="glossary">Secretary of State</a> for some answers.</p> <p pid=".856.0/2">Specifically, I should like the right hon. Gentleman to spell out, as fully as he can, what action the Government&#8212;and especially the Ministry of Defence&#8212;will take to ensure that, in Mrs Kelly's words, no other public servants will in future be unjustifiably be exposed to the ordeal through which her husband passed. There may need to be, for example, further codification of the confidentiality rights of officials. I hope that the <a href="/glossary/?gl=35" title="Ministers make up the Government and almost all are members of the House of..." class="glossary">Minister</a> will say something about that.</p> <p pid=".856.0/3">Lord Hutton's findings raised questions for all of us. We have had a wide-ranging debate, and I think that there has been an admirable spirit of self-criticism, particularly on the part of the governing party. But Lord Hutton's findings are really about the BBC and the media. That is what I want to say a few words about, following in the footsteps of <a href="/mp/?m=1177" title="Our page on Joyce Quin - 'the right hon. Member for Gateshead, East and Washington, West (Joyce Quin)'">Joyce Quin</a> and <a href="/mp/?m=720" title="Our page on Nigel Beard - 'the hon. Member for Bexleyheath and Crayford (Mr. Beard)'">Mr. Beard</a>, who spoke very well on this point.</p> <p pid=".856.0/4">Two camps have emerged in the media since Hutton reported. On the one hand, there are the BBC, its allies and its clients, who have been seeking to portray the <a href="/glossary/?gl=7" title="http://www.the-hutton-inquiry.org.uk/content/report/" class="glossary">Hutton report</a> as an attack on not only the BBC, but also the freedom of the press in general. On the other, there are what I would describe as the honest journalists, who recognise that something serious has gone wrong, not only with the BBC, but also with British journalism in general.</p> <p pid=".856.0/5">With regard to the BBC camp, I will pass over the commentary of such luminaries as <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sir_Simon_Jenkins">Sir Simon Jenkins</a>, who thinks that it is no big deal to say that the <a href="/glossary/?gl=264" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prime_Minister_of_the_United_Ki ngdom" class="glossary">Prime Minister</a> is a liar, and <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lord_Rees-Mogg">Lord Rees-Mogg</a>, who does not think that the BBC has any obligation to provide balanced reporting. I refer only to the thoroughly discredited figure of Mr. <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greg_Dyke">Greg Dyke</a>, who has still not realised that if the editorial processes for which he was responsible had been working properly, my distinguished constituent, Dr. <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Kelly">David Kelly</a>, would still be alive.</p> <p pid=".856.0/6">It is typical of the mendacity with which the BBC conducted its defence after the death of Dr. Kelly that Mr Dyke should now be claiming that Lord Hutton's conclusions will prevent whistleblowers from being reported, unless it can be demonstrated that what they are saying is true. Lord Hutton's report in fact says no such thing, as was pointed out by the distinguished former provincial editor, Sir Richard Storey, in a letter in Monday's edition of <i><a href="/glossary/?gl=49" title="http://www.timesonline.co.uk/" class="glossary">The Times</a></i>, in which he said:</p> <p class="indent" pid=".856.0/7">"some dubiety is being cast"&#8212; here he is referring to the egregious Mr. Dyke&#8212;</p> <p class="indent" pid=".856.0/9">"on Lord Hutton's opinion that, in cases where there is serious contention over the accuracy of a journalist's report, there is a duty on the senior manager personally to check the alleged transgressor's interview notes."</p> <p pid=".856.0/10">On this, he says,</p> <p class="indent" pid=".856.0/11">"Lord Hutton is correct in both theory and practice."</p> <p pid=".856.0/12">No one, says Sir Richard, is</p> <p class="indent" pid=".856.0/13">"too superior, grand or aloof to be personally involved in assessing the accuracy of journalistic copy and the validity of its subsequent publication."</p> <p pid=".856.0/14">So much for Mr. Dyke, who notoriously did not even look at the transcript for a month.</p> <p pid=".856.0/15">Sir Richard Storey is a representative figure in what I have described as the camp of the honest journalists who are worried about what Lord Hutton has revealed about the state of British journalism. Another such is <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sir_Harold_Evans">Sir Harold Evans</a>, who in Tuesday's edition of <i><a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Times">The Times</a></i> called for a royal commission to consider</p> <p class="indent" pid=".856.0/16">"the practices, assumptions, and ethical standards prevailing in journalism/ broadcasting and government-press relations alike".</p> <p pid=".856.0/17">But the doyen of the honest journalists&#8212;he has been quoted several times, but I am going to quote him again&#8212;must surely be the editor of the <i><a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Financial_Times">Financial Times</a></i>, in my view our most distinguished newspaper. <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andrew_Gowers">Andrew Gowers</a> wrote under his own name, in his newspaper, on Saturday. His article was headed "<a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_BBC">The BBC</a>'s failings are a warning to all journalists". If this were the legislature of ancient Athens, I might move a decree that his words be cast in tablets of bronze and compulsorily erected in every media office in the land.</p> <p pid=".856.0/18">Let me summarise his main points. He observes, correctly, that this episode</p> <p class="indent" pid=".856.0/19">"exposed poor editing, deteriorating journalistic values and sloppy management at all levels of Britain's public service broadcaster".</p> <p pid=".856.0/20">At the same time, he says, it</p> <p class="indent" pid=".856.0/21">"holds up a mirror to British journalism as a whole, exposing its foibles and faults".</p> <p pid=".856.0/22">Mr Gowers goes on to say that what has happened must serve</p> <p class="indent" pid=".856.0/23">"as a wake-up call for journalists" against</p> <p class="indent" pid=".856.0/25">"reflexive distrust of every government action or pronouncement", against</p> <p class="indent" pid=".856.0/27">"the easy, superficial certainties of <i>party pris</i> opinion", and must remind them of</p> <p class="indent" pid=".856.0/29">"the virtues of accuracy, context, and verification".</p> <p pid=".856.0/30">I say amen to that.</p> <p pid=".856.0/31">Let me finally turn to the man whose report has precipitated this long overdue crisis of self-criticism in British journalism, Lord Hutton. Here I emphatically disagree with what was said by my hon. Friend <a href="/mp/?m=1147" title="Our page on Richard Ottaway - 'the Member for Croydon, South (Richard Ottaway)'">Richard Ottaway</a>. In the life of a great nation there are many contrasts, and one of the most interesting is always that between the occasional glimpse of bedrock and the froth and foam that usually prevent us from seeing it. We all know that experience from times when the country is at war and our television screens are briefly filled with unfamiliar figures in uniform, whose courage, objectivity and professionalism make us all feel somewhat tawdry and a bit beside the point. Well, watching Lord Hutton reading the findings on television last week, without even looking at the cameras, I had rather the same sensation. Here is a man rooted in his Province, rooted in his profession, rooted in such old-fashioned ideas as the idea of truth corresponding to fact. I salute him.</p>            </div>

                                  <div class="debate-speech__content">                <p pid=".858.0/1">Like other Members on both sides of the House who have spoken today, I certainly believe that throughout this episode the <a href="/glossary/?gl=264" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prime_Minister_of_the_United_Ki ngdom" class="glossary">Prime Minister</a> has always acted and spoken in good faith; but I also believe that in the aftermath of war Parliament has a right and, indeed, a duty to examine the Government's case for military action. In this case, it clearly rests on four main counts, each of which I believe needs to be examined not so much in terms of what we may know now as in terms of what information was available to the Government on each point before the war. I want to ask what I hope are some pertinent questions on that score.</p> <p pid=".858.0/2">First, there is the 45-minute claim, which we know from <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alastair_Campbell">Alastair Campbell</a>'s evidence to the <a href="/glossary/?gl=17" title="http://www.the-hutton-inquiry.org.uk/" class="glossary">Hutton inquiry</a> was included as a result of a request to the Prime <a href="/glossary/?gl=35" title="Ministers make up the Government and almost all are members of the House of..." class="glossary">Minister</a>. Several Members have asked a question to which we need an answer. Why did the dossier not make it clear that the claim applied to battlefield weapons with a short range of only 20 to 40 km, and not to missiles that could strike Cyprus, let alone Britain?</p> <p pid=".858.0/3">There has been some discussion in the debate about whether the Prime Minister was aware of that. My right hon. Friend <a href="/mp/?m=817" title="Our page on Robin Cook - 'the Member for Livingston (Mr. Cook)'">Mr. Cook</a>, in a diary entry on <phrase class="date" code="2004-03-05">5 March</phrase> last year, recorded a conversation to that effect that he had had with the Prime Minister that day. It would seem to suggest that perhaps the Prime Minister did know. I think that we are entitled to ask: when the September dossier was published and the 45-minute claim was widely reported as applying to weapons of mass destruction&#8212;thus greatly exaggerating the threat from Saddam&#8212;why did the Government not make more effort to correct the misreporting, despite believing it to be wrong?</p> <p pid=".858.0/4">Secondly, the dossier claimed that Iraq was seeking to buy 500 tonnes of uranium yellow cake from Niger for nuclear weapons programmes. Britain allegedly received that intelligence from the Italians and passed it on immediately to Washington at the beginning of 2002. <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_CIA">The CIA</a> immediately dispatched a former US ambassador, <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joseph_Wilson">Joseph Wilson</a>, who went to Niger and rapidly confirmed in March 2002 that the claims were wholly bogus. We also know that the CIA later advised Britain for that reason to omit the Niger allegations from the September dossier, so we are entitled to ask why they were still included, even though it had been shown that they were false.</p> <p pid=".858.0/5">Thirdly, on the detailed lists in the dossier of the chemical and biological weapons that Saddam was alleged to have, all the UN inspectors had found was that such weapons were "unaccounted for". That was the relevant phrase, but the dossier clearly implies that the weapons actually existed. The point has been made, particularly by <a href="/mp/?m=1248" title="Our page on John Stanley - 'the right hon. Member for Tonbridge and Malling (Sir John Stanley)'">Sir John Stanley</a>, that many of Iraq's chemical and biological agents produced before the Gulf war would, if they had not already been destroyed, be so degraded more than a decade later as to be ineffective as warfare agents.</p> <p pid=".858.0/6">More particularly, Dr. <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brian_Jones">Brian Jones</a> said in his evidence to the Hutton inquiry that his leading chemical weapons expert was concerned that he could not point to any solid evidence of the production of such weapons by Iraq, yet the Prime Minister's foreword to the September dossier said:</p> <p class="indent" pid=".858.0/7">"What I believe the assessed intelligence has established beyond doubt is that Saddam has continued to produce chemical and biological weapons."</p> <p pid=".858.0/8">Given that the defence intelligence so strongly and widely took the opposite view, how is such a breakdown&#8212;it may have been said in good faith&#8212;in political access to the relevant intelligence to be explained?</p> <p pid=".858.0/9">Fourthly, on the claim that Iraq had produced 4 tonnes of <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/VX">VX</a> nerve agents&#8212;a claim made and supported by <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colin_Powell">Colin Powell</a>&#8212;the Prime Minister told the House on <phrase class="date" code="2004-02-25">25 February</phrase> last year, a month before the war:</p> <p class="indent" pid=".858.0/10">"It was only four years later"&#8212; in 1995&#8212;</p> <p class="indent" pid=".858.0/12">"after the defection of Saddam's son-in-law to Jordan, that the offensive biological weapons and the full extent of the nuclear programme were discovered."&#8212;[<a href="/search/?pop=1&s=date:20030225+column:123+section:debates"><i>Hansard</i>, 25 February 2003; Vol. 400, c. 123</a>.]</p> <p pid=".858.0/13">It so happened that, a week later, <i>Newsweek</i> obtained details of <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hussein_Kamal">Hussein Kamal</a>'s actual <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Atomic_Energy_Agency">International Atomic Energy Agency</a> and <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UNSCOM">UNSCOM</a> debriefing interview. It revealed that he apparently said the reverse, as my hon. Friend <a href="/mp/?m=1021" title="Our page on Peter Kilfoyle - 'the Member for Liverpool, Walton (Mr. Kilfoyle)'">Mr. Kilfoyle</a> has already mentioned. After setting out the evidence in great detail&#8212;embarrassingly so, as one official said&#8212;Kamal concluded that</p> <p class="indent" pid=".858.0/14">"all weapons&#8212;biological, chemical, missile, nuclear were destroyed."</p> <p pid=".858.0/15">I believe that that deserves some explanation, and I hope that my right hon. Friend the <a href="/glossary/?gl=23" title="Secretary of State was originally the title given to the two officials who..." class="glossary">Secretary of State</a> for Defence can throw some light on that and other discrepancies when he winds up the debate.</p> <p pid=".858.0/16">We look to the Butler committee to explain why, in particular, we were told in the September dossier that Saddam's WMD programme was "active, detailed and growing" and that the intelligence that that judgment was based on was "extensive, detailed and authoritative", when, in fact, Saddam had no WMD at all. That must be central to the new inquiry.</p> <p pid=".858.0/17">There are two other key issues for the new <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Privy_Councillor">Privy Councillor</a> committee to throw some light on. The <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intelligence_and_Security_Committee">Intelligence and Security Committee</a> report revealed that on <phrase class="date" code="2004-02-10">10 February</phrase>, five weeks before the war, the Prime Minister received an intelligence assessment of the impact on international terrorism of taking military action against Iraq. It judged that al-Qaeda represented&#8212;and no one would dispute it&#8212;by far the greatest terrorist threat to western interests and that the threat was heightened, not reduced, by military action against Iraq. Why was that rather crucial assessment not given to Parliament before the <phrase class="date" code="2004-03-18">18 March</phrase> vote on military action? It could have had a significant effect on opinion in this House.</p> <p pid=".858.0/18">My second point returns to the central question. How is it that we were taken to war in Iraq on the grounds that Saddam had WMD, when in fact he did not? Hutton says that the politicians did not manipulate the data, and I accept that. Did the intelligence services get the matter drastically wrong, or did they simply cherry-pick the data to provide the conclusions that they believed their political masters wanted?</p> <p pid=".858.0/19">The latter was clearly implied by Dr. Brian Jones. He has pointed out forcefully how widespread was the disgruntlement among defence intelligence staff at the way officials at the top of the intelligence hierarchy were consorting too closely&#8212;</p>            </div>

That is true not just for the reasons that are normally presented but because&#8212;just occasionally&#8212;a jury ignores the judge's careful explanation of the law and delivers a legally quixotic verdict. In such instances, a jury seems to be saying, "You want us to deliver a verdict on the basis of the law, but we are going to deliver one on the basis of justice."</p> <p pid=".860.1/2">I accept that <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lord_Hutton">Lord Hutton</a> is an honourable and very able man, but, unsurprisingly, he thinks like a lawyer. He sat without the benefit of a jury or even lay assessors. He determined the terms of reference and the scope of his inquiry. In each of the judgments that he arrived at, he decided that the benefit of the doubt should be given to the Government. He may well have been right in law to find that, if a matter could not be proven, then the Government&#8212;as the defendant&#8212;had to be judged innocent. I am less sure that his judgment was balanced or just.</p> <p pid=".860.1/3">We know that <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alastair_Campbell">Alastair Campbell</a> is celebrated for his forceful personality and his ability to persuade reluctant officials to bend to his masters' will, and also that the language in the September dossier implied greater certainty than the intelligence services had originally proposed. We have seen&#8212;too often&#8212;that the <a href="/glossary/?gl=264" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prime_Minister_of_the_United_Ki ngdom" class="glossary">Prime Minister</a>, although not departing from the truth, sometimes leaves an impression that is erroneous. The reference to 45 minutes in the September dossier was taken by many to refer to long-range weapons. Other respected commentators expressed doubts that were similar to those voiced, over-trenchantly, by Mr. Gilligan.</p> <p pid=".860.1/4">As far back as <phrase class="date" code="2002-09-19">19 September 2002</phrase>, the dossier's impact was being stiffened up. The Prime <a href="/glossary/?gl=35" title="Ministers make up the Government and almost all are members of the House of..." class="glossary">Minister</a>'s chief of staff, <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jonathan_Powell">Jonathan Powell</a>, e-mailed <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Scarlett">John Scarlett</a> to say that the statement on page 19 of the draft dossier regarding Saddam's possible use of biological and chemical weapons was</p> <p class="indent" pid=".860.1/5">"a bit of a problem. It backs up the . . . argument that there is no chemical and biological weapons threat and will only create one if we attack him. I think you should redraft the para."</p> <p pid=".860.1/6">John Scarlett stated in his evidence to the <a href="/glossary/?gl=17" title="http://www.the-hutton-inquiry.org.uk/" class="glossary">Hutton inquiry</a> that he responded to this e-mail, altering the wording and, I suggest, embellishing the imminence of the risk that Saddam Hussein posed. So the substance of Gilligan's reporting did not lack foundation.</p>            </div>

I do not know whether that was, in part, due to the short interruption of our proceedings or whether it would have happened of itself, but there seems to be no doubt that this afternoon we have highlighted the absolute necessity of conducting debate in a rational and courteous manner. As a result, the contributions of every Member seem to have matched the seriousness of the matters that we have to consider. Indeed, listening to what was said has made me happy and proud to be a Member of the House.</p> <p pid=".862.1/2">The debate has concentrated principally on the issue of weapons of mass destruction. I shall deal with those contributions first, and I then hope to be able to deal further with some of the points that, curiously, have not been touched on, even though they are important in the context of the report, especially to the Kelly family.</p> <p pid=".862.1/3">The most startling piece of information about weapons of mass destruction to emerge during the debate was that the <a href="/glossary/?gl=264" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prime_Minister_of_the_United_Ki ngdom" class="glossary">Prime Minister</a> indicated, in response to a question, that he was not aware that WMD referred to battlefield weapons before the debate on <phrase class="date" code="2004-03-18">18 March</phrase> last year. That is an extremely important comment. By removing the taint of mendacity from Ministers, <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lord_Hutton">Lord Hutton</a> has done the House the great service of enabling us to concentrate on issues of competence&#8212;a central area that the House may want to consider this evening, and one that will doubtless be the subject of the inquiry's scrutiny.</p> <p pid=".862.1/4">At this stage, however, I have a question for the <a href="/glossary/?gl=23" title="Secretary of State was originally the title given to the two officials who..." class="glossary">Secretary of State</a> for Defence. If that was indeed the Prime <a href="/glossary/?gl=35" title="Ministers make up the Government and almost all are members of the House of..." class="glossary">Minister</a>'s position on <phrase class="date" code="2004-03-18">18 March</phrase>, it is obviously in conflict with position enunciated by <a href="/mp/?m=817" title="Our page on Robin Cook - 'the right hon. Member for Livingston (Mr. Cook)'">Mr. Cook</a>, who made his opinions crystal clear. He said:</p> <p class="indent" pid=".862.1/5">"Iraq probably has no weapons of mass destruction in the commonly understood sense of the term&#8212;namely a credible device capable of being delivered against a strategic city target.&#8212;[<a href="/search/?pop=1&s=date:20030317+column:727+section:debates"><i>Hansard</i>, 17 March 2003; Vol. 401, c. 727</a>.]</p> <p pid=".862.1/6">In addition, the Prime Minister's position is contrary to what the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secretary_of_State_for_Defence">Secretary of State for Defence</a> said to the <a href="/glossary/?gl=17" title="http://www.the-hutton-inquiry.org.uk/" class="glossary">Hutton inquiry</a>. When the right hon. Gentleman was being questioned by Mr. Gompertz, counsel for the Kelly family, he was asked on two occasions:</p> <p class="indent" pid=".862.1/7">"Was there any other suggestion that they were not battlefield munitions but strategic munitions?"</p> <p pid=".862.1/8">He answered:</p> <p class="indent" pid=".862.1/9">"I recall asking what kind of weapons would be deployable within 45 minutes; and the answer is the answer that I have just given to you."</p> <p pid=".862.1/10">Mr. Gompertz said:</p> <p class="indent" pid=".862.1/11">"Which was shells, battlefield mortars, tactical weapons of that kind?"</p> <p pid=".862.1/12">Mr. Hoon replied: "Yes".</p> <p pid=".862.1/13">When the Secretary of State winds up, will he explain the discrepancy between his position and that of the Prime Minister? Could it be that in fact the Secretary of State knew on <phrase class="date" code="2004-03-18">18 March</phrase> that the reference was only to battlefield weapons, but that he had not told the Prime Minister? If that is the case, it seems to me that the House is entitled to know how that divergence of view came about. I hope that that will be the first thing that the Secretary of State for Defence addresses when he rises at the <a href="/glossary/?gl=171" title="If you've ever seen inside the Commons, you'll notice a large table in the..." class="glossary">Dispatch Box</a> to reply to the debate.</p> <p pid=".862.1/14">In addition, we heard many contributions relating to the wider WMD issues. I apologise for the fact that I cannot do justice to all of them in the time available. My right hon. Friend <a href="/mp/?m=1050" title="Our page on Peter Lilley - 'the Member for Hitchin and Harpenden (Mr. Lilley)'">Mr. Lilley</a> asked about the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Law_Officers">Law Officers</a>' advice. I am perfectly aware of the convention that Law Officers' advice is not normally made public, but I ask whether that could be reviewed in this case. Frankly, if it comes out in dribs and drabs during the committee's inquiry, it would be much better if the Government were up front about it, even if they have to carry out some redaction of any part of it that might raise intelligence issues. In the <a href="/glossary/?gl=7" title="http://www.the-hutton-inquiry.org.uk/content/report/" class="glossary">Hutton report</a>, the redacted pages are so poorly done that people can read what is said underneath anyway, which does not suggest that the material was of the highest confidentiality.</p> <p pid=".862.1/15">In addition, we heard all the doubts expressed about the dossier, and there is no doubt that that will be an important area to consider. My right hon. Friend <a href="/mp/?m=929" title="Our page on John Gummer - 'the Member for Suffolk, Coastal (Mr. Gummer)'">Mr. Gummer</a> made an extremely powerful contribution on that point, as did my hon. Friends the Members for <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_Essex">North Essex</a> (Mr. Jenkin) and for Henley (Mr. Johnson). The absolutely central issue remains that the Government have got to provide reassurance that the terms of reference that they have set out for the committee's inquiry are fully understood and accepted across the House.</p> <p pid=".862.1/16">My right hon. Friend the <a href="/glossary/?gl=175" title="The &quot;Leader of the Opposition&quot; is head of &quot;Her Majesty's Official..." class="glossary">Leader of the Opposition</a> insisted on changes to the text specifically to include reference to the use made by the Government of intelligence before the conflict and the difference between that intelligence and what has been discovered by the Iraq survey group. I have to tell the Secretary of State for Defence that I was alarmed yesterday that the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foreign_Secretary">Foreign Secretary</a> appeared to try to slip away from the clear implications of that text, which must be that the use made by the Government of the intelligence in persuading the British people that it was right to go to war must be a subject of examination. I very much hope that he, or the Prime Minister, will provide that reassurance before this afternoon's debate is out; otherwise it will be suggested that those of us who wish to co-operate to uphold the integrity of the Government are signing up to a false prospectus. We are entitled to a reply to that during the debate.</p>            </div>

Gentleman, whom I would call a friend in any context outside the House, that I will come to that point before I finish my comments and give the <a href="/glossary/?gl=23" title="Secretary of State was originally the title given to the two officials who..." class="glossary">Secretary of State</a> for Defence the opportunity to reply.</p> <p pid=".864.0/2">For those purposes, the text that sets up the committee is fine, but it would be nice to know that the Government's interpretation of that text, which is crystal clear in itself, accepts the fact that the committee can consider the use made by the Government of that intelligence material. We are entitled to an answer.</p> <p pid=".864.0/3">In the time available, I wish to turn away from the subject of WMD, which has been the main issue in the debate, to another matter that causes me considerable problems. <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lord_Hutton">Lord Hutton</a>'s report dealt with the BBC's role, and I have absolutely no difficulty with his findings on the lack of editorial control. I was particularly struck by the <a href="/glossary/?gl=264" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prime_Minister_of_the_United_Ki ngdom" class="glossary">Prime Minister</a>'s comment in defining what he thought proper journalism was, when he told the House that it is a question of proper scrutiny of what is said, and the willingness to retract if something wrong has been said. I agree with him entirely on that.</p> <p pid=".864.0/4">I am bound to say, however, that it seems to me that the BBC has a point when it raises its anxieties about paragraph 282 of the report, in which a rather bald statement is made that the difference between reporting a source or reporting directly is</p> <p class="indent" pid=".864.0/5">"not a distinction recognised by the law in relation to actions for defamation."</p> <p pid=".864.0/6">Higher up the page, reference is made to the case of Reynolds <i>v.</i> <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Times_Newspapers">Times Newspapers</a>&#8212;which, I must say to the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foreign_Secretary">Foreign Secretary</a>, in his <a href="/glossary/?gl=128" title="In the process of debate, members of parliament need to stand up in order..." class="glossary">sedentary position</a>, says exactly the opposite. Not much turns on that, because Lord Hutton makes it clear in his conclusions that his criticism is about what the BBC did, and in the context of this case I have no difficulty at all in accepting that that distinction is valueless in view of the surrounding circumstances, particularly in view of Mr. Gilligan's misquotation of what Dr. Kelly told him.</p> <p pid=".864.0/7">I hope for some reassurance, however, that that quote will not be used to go behind the clear judgment in the Reynolds case, because the judgment is clear that under the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_Rights_Act_1998">Human Rights Act 1998</a>, and the principle of freedom of expression, a latitude is given to journalists to enable them to report sources if they believe them to be credible. That is an important protection, and some of the powerful contributions to this afternoon's debate on the subject of the BBC seem to me to go straight to that issue.</p>            </div>

                                  <div class="debate-speech__content">                <p pid=".865.2/1">I am sorry, I cannot. I must allow enough time for the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Defence_Secretary">Defence Secretary</a>.</p> <p pid=".865.2/2">I now turn to the issue that was raised by the leader of the Liberal Democrats. He said that Dr. Kennedy&#8212;[Hon. Members: "Kelly."] He said that Dr. Kelly should have been better treated because of his senior position. Surely, that entirely misses the point. Dr. Kelly was entitled to the ordinary protection given to employees. I must say to the <a href="/glossary/?gl=23" title="Secretary of State was originally the title given to the two officials who..." class="glossary">Secretary of State</a> that what shines through the <a href="/glossary/?gl=7" title="http://www.the-hutton-inquiry.org.uk/content/report/" class="glossary">Hutton report</a> is not that the decision at the end of the day to disclose Dr. Kelly's name was wrong&#8212;I fully understand that when the checks and balances had been worked out, that had to happen. In fact, however, the report discloses that there was zero system whatever for evaluating his rights as an employee. Strictly, under the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_Protection_Act_1998">Data Protection Act 1998</a>, his name should not even have been given by the Ministry of Defence to the <a href="/glossary/?gl=108" title="The cabinet is the group of twenty or so (and no more than 22) senior..." class="glossary">Cabinet</a> Office and the <a href="/glossary/?gl=264" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prime_Minister_of_the_United_Ki ngdom" class="glossary">Prime Minister</a>'s office without an evaluation of his data protection rights. The Government pass <a href="/glossary/?gl=38" title="Laws are the rules by which a country is governed. Britain has a long..." class="glossary">laws</a> to apply to everybody else, but my complaint is not about the law itself but about the fact that they do not adhere to it themselves.</p> <p pid=".865.2/3">If I may say so to the Defence Secretary, I do not accuse him of perfidy in this matter. In the early 1990s, I spent my time representing Government Departments, and I can assure him that on every employment matter in which I was involved, it was clear that they were unable to adhere to their own procedures and systems. It is all very well saying that Dr. Kelly was properly treated, but the evidence at the end of the day is that there was no such evaluation. When it came to the crunch, the people who took the decisions that related to his status as an employee were not <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MOD">MOD</a> officials at all but members of the Prime <a href="/glossary/?gl=35" title="Ministers make up the Government and almost all are members of the House of..." class="glossary">Minister</a>'s communications department. I hope very much that the Defence Secretary will deal with those points when he comes to wind up. Plainly, one of the grievances of the Kelly family is the sense that Dr. Kelly was ill used. Had the procedures been properly followed, the Defence Secretary would have been in a much better position to say that Dr. Kelly had not been ill used than he is now.</p> <p pid=".865.2/4">The point raised by my hon. and learned Friend <a href="/mp/?m=906" title="Our page on Edward Garnier - 'the Member for Harborough (Mr. Garnier)'">Mr. Garnier</a> and others relates to the Government's reputation for truthfulness or otherwise. It is a pertinent issue, because the one thing that shines through this afternoon's debate is that although there have been some attacks and some discussions about whether Mr. Gilligan might be a scoundrel, it is certainly not suggested that Mr. Dyke or Mr. Davies is. Indeed, the evidence relating to Dr. Kelly does not suggest that he was acting maliciously either. Yet, as my right hon. Friend <a href="/mp/?m=1075" title="Our page on Andrew MacKay - 'the Member for Bracknell (Mr. Mackay)'">Mr. Mackay</a> said, every one of those individuals got themselves into a situation whereby they came to distrust the Government so much that they were drawn into conflict with them or adopted positions from which they could not back down.</p> <p pid=".865.2/5">Three weeks after I was elected in 1997, my hon. Friend <a href="/mp/?m=1024" title="Our page on Julie Kirkbride - 'the Member for Bromsgrove (Miss Kirkbride)'">Miss Kirkbride</a> and I, among others, were taken out by representatives of the BBC, who, we were told, had concluded that their style of reporting was too confrontational and that they would endeavour in future to be more understanding of politicians' difficulties. What happened in the intervening period to create a situation whereby the director-general and the chairman&#8212;both of whom have been donors to the Labour party and must therefore, one assumes, be favourable towards it&#8212;felt that their relations with the Government had so broken down?</p> <p pid=".865.2/6">My hon. Friend <a href="/mp/?m=820" title="Our page on Patrick Cormack - 'the Member for South Staffordshire (Sir Patrick Cormack)'">Sir Patrick Cormack</a> praised the Prime Minister for his eloquence&#8212;indeed, we heard plenty of that in the debate on the war with Iraq. However, the problem is that while eloquence, sincerity and powers of communication may do much good for our country&#8212;I say that, although I disagree with Government policies&#8212;an entirely different attitude is taken by the weasels in the background, from <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jo_Moore">Jo Moore</a> trying to bury bad news on <phrase class="date" code="2004-09-11">11 September</phrase> to Mr. Campbell deciding, as is recorded in his diary, that the key issue in relation to Dr. Kelly was a plea bargain. I am extremely pleased that Mr. Campbell has left the service of the Government and is no longer being funded by the taxpayer.</p> <p pid=".865.2/7">I say this to the Defence Secretary: unless the Government can learn the lesson that their spin, developed over seven years, has led to such a monumental growth of distrust that they are no longer believed even when they are telling the truth, we will continue to have a problem. Indicative of that problem is the fact that when the Prime Minister was first asked on the plane whether he had been involved in the naming of Dr. Kelly, he felt so frightened and constrained&#8212;because at that stage nobody had pointed out that he was entitled to name him&#8212;that he had to give an obfuscatory reply. As long as that continues, this country is in serious difficulty, and the Government will be judged on their record in putting that right in future.</p>            </div>

My only observation is that many of those speeches anticipated the report of the next inquiry instead of dealing with the report of the inquiry that has just taken place. That is exemplified by <a href="/mp/?m=924" title="Our page on Dominic Grieve - 'the hon. Member for Beaconsfield (Mr. Grieve)'">Mr. Grieve</a>&#8212;although, as the excellent lawyer that I know him to be, he will not want to waste a good speech, so he will be able to use large parts of it on the next occasion.</p> <p pid=".866.0/2">I join right hon. and hon. Members in thanking the noble and learned <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lord_Hutton">Lord Hutton</a> for producing such a detailed and comprehensive report. I am sure that I speak for all those involved in stating that we are grateful for the efficiency and dispatch with which he completed what was always likely to be a difficult task.</p> <p pid=".866.0/3">I also join right hon. and hon. Members in deprecating the attacks on the noble and learned Lord Hutton. My hon. Friend <a href="/mp/?m=720" title="Our page on Nigel Beard - 'the Member for Bexleyheath and Crayford (Mr. Beard)'">Mr. Beard</a> made that point with his usual eloquence. I was surprised that <a href="/mp/?m=1053" title="Our page on Elfyn Llwyd - 'the hon. Member for Meirionnydd Nant Conwy (Mr. Llwyd)'">Mr. Llwyd</a> criticised Lord Hutton's report, because I recall him saying last year:</p> <p class="indent" pid=".866.0/4">"However, I, like others, am impressed by the way that the <a href="/glossary/?gl=17" title="http://www.the-hutton-inquiry.org.uk/" class="glossary">Hutton inquiry</a> was set up and is proceeding. That could well be a model."&#8212;[<a href="/search/?pop=1&s=date:20031022+column:704+section:debates"><i>Hansard</i>, 22 October 2003; Vol. 411, c. 704</a>.]</p> <p pid=".866.0/5">Lord Hutton's task was difficult, not least because it began with a personal tragedy and involved a detailed assessment of the reactions and judgments of a series of individuals, each of whom was subjected to a far greater degree of scrutiny than would otherwise ever have been the case. For some, it may well have been their first experience of the particular kind of public scrutiny that the British media bring to bear. That necessarily affected their families and their friends.</p> <p pid=".866.0/6">But it is important to start with <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Kelly">David Kelly</a>. In his report, Lord Hutton quoted the citation recommending Dr. Kelly for the award of the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CMG">CMG</a>. It commended Dr. Kelly's pioneering work as an arms inspector in the former <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soviet_Union">Soviet Union</a> and in Iraq and stated:</p> <p class="indent" pid=".866.0/7">"he has pursued this work tirelessly and with good humour, despite the significant hardship, hostility and personal risk encountered during extended periods of service in both countries."</p> <p pid=".866.0/8">That says much about the man. At the heart of this debate is the tragedy that such a dedicated man took his own life. It is a particular tragedy for Mrs. Kelly and her family. When I met them last summer, I was touched by their courage, kindness and dignity. The publication of Lord Hutton's findings has once again made the cause of their private grief the subject of public debate. That is a heavy burden for any family to bear, and our thoughts are certainly with them.</p> <p pid=".866.0/9">On the detail of the report itself in so far as it affects the Ministry of Defence, and in terms of learning lessons, as suggested by <a href="/mp/?m=974" title="Our page on Michael Howard - 'the right hon. and learned Member for Folkestone and Hythe (Mr. Howard)'">Mr. Howard</a>, Lord Hutton decided that the major charges levelled against the Ministry of Defence were unfounded. In particular, he found that there was no dishonourable, underhand or duplicitous Government strategy covertly to leak Dr. Kelly's name to the media.</p>            </div>

He also said that the Ministry of Defence was at fault in not having set up a procedure to inform Dr. Kelly immediately when his name had been confirmed to the press.</p> <p pid=".867.1/3">I acknowledge that it would have been better if we had told Dr. Kelly explicitly that his name would be confirmed if a journalist suggested it and if there had been a procedure to inform him immediately when he had been identified by the press. Lord Hutton was satisfied, however, that Dr. Kelly had been told by the Ministry of Defence that his name would probably come out and that he realised this himself. With the benefit of hindsight, I accept that we probably placed too much reliance on this fact.</p> <p pid=".867.1/4">Lord Hutton has recognised, however, that the circumstances leading to Dr. Kelly's death were, to use his words, "wholly exceptional". Moreover, he acknowledged that there were mitigating circumstances: first, <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dr_Kelly">Dr Kelly</a>'s exposure to press attention, which was inevitable in any event, was only one of the factors placing him under stress; secondly, <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MOD">MOD</a> officials did give consideration to Dr. Kelly's welfare and did take steps to help him; and thirdly, Dr. Kelly was not an easy man to help. This is not a criticism. He seems to have reacted in the way in which many essentially private people would react to public exposure&#8212;he wanted to keep himself to himself.</p>            </div>

Gentleman will forgive me, I need to make progress.</p> <p pid=".868.5/2">Dr. Kelly's subsequent exposure to press attention and intrusion was not in any way brought about by the delay in advising him that his name had been confirmed&#8212;and neither has it been suggested that this delay in any way contributed to his decision to take his own life. It is important that I note on behalf of the Ministry of Defence that there was no criticism of any individual in relation to the support provided to Dr. Kelly.</p> <p pid=".868.5/3">I am nevertheless determined that the Ministry of Defence should reflect on what has happened. Officials have been giving a great deal of thought to a range of personnel issues that were highlighted by, even if they were not strictly relevant to, the case of Dr. Kelly. Various procedures will be improved. Some of them will be in areas that were not addressed in the report. We shall look at terms of employment, where some aspects relating to secondments from the Ministry of Defence or between the Ministry of Defence and other public or private organisations will be clarified. Disciplinary and related procedures, including arrangements for raising issues of conscience or professional disquiet, will also be considered. I hope that that will meet the point raised by <a href="/mp/?m=724" title="Our page on Alan Beith - 'the right hon. Member for Berwick-upon-Tweed (Mr. Beith)'">Mr. Beith</a>. This will cover the entire Ministry, including, of course, the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Defence_Intelligence_Staff">Defence Intelligence Staff</a>.</p> <p pid=".868.5/4">We shall examine also the assistance given to civil servants who are at risk of media attention. Nowadays there is a risk of intrusion that would not have occurred even a few years ago. As for guidance on dealing with the media, the principle will remain unchanged that no one should speak to the media on or off the record without express approval. I hope that that addresses at least some of the concerns raised by <a href="/mp/?m=994" title="Our page on Robert Jackson - 'the hon. Member for Wantage (Mr. Jackson)'">Mr. Jackson</a> in what I thought was an excellent speech.</p>            </div>

Friend makes a relevant point.</p> <p pid=".869.1/2">The welfare service of the Ministry of Defence has been in close contact with Dr. Kelly's family at the relevant times. It has been available to provide whatever support the family requested. Mrs. Kelly's solicitor has been told that my right hon. Friend the <a href="/glossary/?gl=264" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prime_Minister_of_the_United_Ki ngdom" class="glossary">Prime Minister</a> and I are both available to talk to Mrs. Kelly if she would like us to do so. I was grateful to her for agreeing to see me last summer. I repeat that in the course of a long conversation I was profoundly impressed both by her compassion and by her understanding.</p> <p pid=".869.1/3">Such understanding must now be extended to others caught up in these events. Many were involved simply because they held particular posts at the relevant time. They were carrying out their professional responsibilities in a way that was required by virtue of their employment&#8212;responsibilities that had never previously thrown them into the media spotlight and which will almost certainly never again involve them in such attention.</p> <p pid=".869.1/4"><a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lord_Hutton">Lord Hutton</a> was asked by the Government to investigate the circumstances surrounding the death of Dr. Kelly. He was not asked to make a wider inquiry. I think that that is the answer to a number of criticisms of the scope of the inquiry, including those from my hon. Friend <a href="/mp/?m=1168" title="Our page on Gordon Prentice - 'the Member for Pendle (Mr. Prentice)'">Mr. Prentice</a>. Normally an unexplained death is investigated by a coroner. In this case it would have been difficult for an inquest adequately to investigate the intense controversy that raged in this country and elsewhere following the broadcast by <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andrew_Gilligan">Andrew Gilligan</a> on "Today" on <phrase class="date" code="2003-05-29">29 May 2003</phrase>.</p>            </div>

There was not a debate in September about the nature of the delivery process. I asked the question out of curiosity. I did not expect&#8212;<i>[Interruption.]</i> That is because it was not an issue. I would be very pleased if the right hon. and learned Gentleman, who is again getting excited about these matters, would indicate when this became a political issue as far as he was concerned. It was not in September 2003.</p> <p pid=".870.3/2">I and other witnesses indicated in evidence to <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lord_Hutton">Lord Hutton</a> that the media reporting that followed the broadcast questioned the Government's integrity in just about the most fundamental way imaginable. Above all, it challenged the integrity of my right hon. Friend the <a href="/glossary/?gl=264" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prime_Minister_of_the_United_Ki ngdom" class="glossary">Prime Minister</a>. It suggested that he and I were prepared to commit Britain's armed forces, and to risk and lose their lives, on the basis of information that we apparently knew to be false. In such circumstances, nothing but a public inquiry could have established the facts and helped to restore public confidence.</p> <p pid=".870.3/3">A public inquiry is rightly a rigorous process for those who appear before it. I have no doubt that everyone who gave evidence would agree with me at least on that. Each individual's thoughts, actions and decisions were subjected to minute scrutiny by an array of legal minds. That is not a comfortable experience for anyone&#8212;nor, given the questions involved, should it be.</p>            </div>

Some parts of the media were so determined to attack the Government, whatever the evidence, that it was sometimes difficult to reconcile what had taken place inside the inquiry with the following day's reports. There were even stories that were no more than fabrication, apparently printed solely to discredit officials who appeared as witnesses.</p> <p pid=".871.2/3">No one can object to fair and balanced criticism, but people&#8212;and particularly civil servants who are not allowed to answer back&#8212;should not have to suffer deliberate denigration of that sort. Civil servants in this country are hard-working, dedicated public servants; they are not party political and they serve Governments of all parties. I am sure that all parties in the House would want to see their professional independence maintained and safeguarded. <i>[Interruption.]</i> I hear the comments from <a href="/mp/?m=1075" title="Our page on Andrew MacKay - 'the right hon. Member for Bracknell (Mr. Mackay)'">Mr. Mackay</a>, who I thought made a disgraceful attack on a serving civil servant&#8212;a civil servant who had apologised and who had made a mistake which he accepted. I doubt whether when the right hon. Gentleman served as a <a href="/glossary/?gl=35" title="Ministers make up the Government and almost all are members of the House of..." class="glossary">Minister</a> he would have tolerated that kind of public attack on a civil servant trying conscientiously to do his job.</p> <p pid=".871.2/4">I believe that the House should again consider in particular <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lord_Hutton">Lord Hutton</a>'s observations in paragraph 280 of his report. This is an important restatement of the basic principles governing the relationship between the media and individuals working in government. A number of Members dealt with those issues, including my right hon. Friend <a href="/mp/?m=1177" title="Our page on Joyce Quin - 'the Member for Gateshead, East and Washington, West (Joyce Quin)'">Joyce Quin</a>, my hon. Friend <a href="/mp/?m=1078" title="Our page on Andrew MacKinlay - 'the Member for Thurrock (Andrew Mackinlay)'">Andrew Mackinlay</a>, and my right hon. Friends the Members for Swansea, East (<a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Anderson">Donald Anderson</a>), for <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manchester,_Gorton">Manchester, Gorton</a> (Mr. Kaufman) and for Hartlepool (Mr. Mandelson), who all made revealing and important comments on that relationship.</p> <p pid=".871.2/5">Lord Hutton's report has itself been the subject of some strong criticism, as has the learned and noble Lord. The report has been described as "a curiously unbalanced document". It has been said that</p> <p class="indent" pid=".871.2/6">"Lord Hutton leaves himself open to accusations of having cherry picked the evidence", and that he</p> <p class="indent" pid=".871.2/8">"blithely ignores or is ignorant of the context in which this sordid and unedifying saga unfolded".</p> <p pid=".871.2/9">That criticism has related both to the specific findings on the facts and, in more general terms, to the fact that Lord Hutton's conclusions could in some way limit the freedom of expression. There has been wide reporting of <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greg_Dyke">Greg Dyke</a>'s view that the implications for journalism are grave and that there will be a legal sea change that silences whistleblowers.</p> <p pid=".871.2/10">Given the gravity of such criticism, it is worth examining what Lord Hutton set out. I apologise for quoting him in full. He states in paragraph 280:</p> <p class="indent" pid=".871.2/11">"Counsel for the BBC and for Mr Gilligan were right to state that the communication by the media of information (including information obtained by investigative reporters) on matters of public interest and importance is a vital part of life in a democratic society. However the right to communicate such information is subject to the qualification (which itself exists for the benefit of a democratic society) that false accusations of fact impugning the integrity of others, including politicians, should not be made by the media. Where a reporter is intending to broadcast or publish information impugning the integrity of others the management of his broadcasting company or newspaper should ensure that a system is in place whereby his editor or editors give careful consideration to the wording of the report and to whether it is right in all the circumstances to broadcast or publish it."</p> <p pid=".871.2/12">This reflects precisely the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Press_Complaints_Commission">Press Complaints Commission</a>'s code of practice, which all our national newspapers are supposed to uphold. On accuracy, it states:</p> <p class="indent" pid=".871.2/13">"Newspapers and periodicals must take care not to publish inaccurate, misleading or distorted material including pictures."</p> <p pid=".871.2/14">I emphasise the phrase:</p> <p class="indent" pid=".871.2/15">"take care not to publish inaccurate . . . material".</p> <p pid=".871.2/16">In concluding this debate, let me repeat that the Government accept the report&#8212;</p> <p class="italic" pid=".871.2/17">It being Seven o'clock, the motion for the <a href="/glossary/?gl=118" title="An adjournment is a break in the course of parliamentary business.    The..." class="glossary">Adjournment of the House</a> lapsed, without Question put.</p>            </div>
