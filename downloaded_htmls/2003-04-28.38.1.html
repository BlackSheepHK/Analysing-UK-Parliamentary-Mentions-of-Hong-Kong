It presented initially as an unknown illness causing fever and severe chest symptoms, including pneumonia. Since then, laboratories around the world, including those in the United Kingdom, have been working to pinpoint the precise cause of this serious new illness. At this stage there is neither a test to diagnose SARS, nor an antidote to treat it.</p> <p pid=".38.1/2">SARS has spread to 26 countries, but it has been concentrated in a handful of areas, with major outbreaks in <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hong_Kong">Hong Kong</a>, Hanoi, Beijing and other parts of China, Singapore, and Toronto in Canada. According to the most up-to-date information, which I received from the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WHO">WHO</a> this morning, there have been 4,836 probable cases of SARS worldwide and 293 deaths.</p> <p pid=".38.1/3">There are, of course, understandable public concerns about the impact that SARS might have in the United Kingdom. I can confirm to the House that in this country to date there have been just six probable cases of SARS. The last reported case was admitted to hospital on <phrase class="date" code="2003-04-10">10 April</phrase>. All the patients involved were quickly identified and have been successfully looked after by the NHS. All have now returned home and are well. The chief medical officer, Professor Sir Liam Donaldson, has advised that at present SARS poses a low risk for people in this country, so, serious though SARS is, it is important to keep it in perspective.</p> <p pid=".38.1/4">Our response has been to take a precautionary but proportionate approach. The handling of SARS in this country has been informed, as it must continue to be, by the best scientific and medical advice. In particular, the chief medical officer and the new <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health_Protection_Agency">Health Protection Agency</a>, in advising Ministers and the health service, have been working extremely closely with the World Health Organisation, which has the global responsibility for dealing with the disease. Throughout, we have followed WHO advice to the letter.</p> <p pid=".38.1/5">It might help the House if I set out the action that has been taken to date and the further action that we now propose.</p> <p pid=".38.1/6">First, we have provided early, accurate information to both the public and the health service. The <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CMO">CMO</a> contacted all doctors on <phrase class="date" code="2003-03-14">14 March</phrase> and subsequently on <phrase class="date" code="2003-04-07">7 April</phrase> with detailed information on the symptoms and signs of SARS, and what to do if they encountered a possible case. Up-to-date information on SARS is also available to the public on the WHO, <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HPA">HPA</a> and <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Department_of_Health">Department of Health</a> websites, as well as through the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NHS_Direct">NHS Direct</a> telephone helpline, which many members of the public have contacted.</p> <p pid=".38.1/7">Secondly, we have put in place high-quality public health surveillance to enable the disease to be tracked closely. In early March, the Health Protection Agency set up a system for reporting suspect and probable cases. Thirdly, the chief medical officer issued advice to people travelling abroad on <phrase class="date" code="2003-04-02">2 April</phrase> and, subsequently, on <phrase class="date" code="2003-04-23">23 April</phrase> in line with WHO recommendations. He strongly advised against travel to specific SARS-affected areas. That remains his very strong advice.</p> <p pid=".38.1/8">Fourthly, the WHO has advised that passengers should be screened on departure from the countries affected, and as a further precaution, in line with that WHO guidance, information has been distributed to the main airports in this country giving advice to returning travellers on SARS.</p> <p pid=".38.1/9">Fifthly, we have laid down, in line with WHO advice, specific requirements through guidance issued by the CMO on <phrase class="date" code="2003-03-14">14 March</phrase> and <phrase class="date" code="2003-04-07">7 April</phrase> on the management of patients within NHS hospitals to reduce the risks of cross-infection.</p> <p pid=".38.1/10">Sixthly, and perhaps most importantly for the long term, we have put our country's considerable scientific expertise to work in helping to identify a causative organism for SARS. The HPA central laboratory in Colindale was a key part of the international collaboration that led to the identification of the likely cause. It is also at the leading edge of work to discover an accurate diagnostic test.</p> <p pid=".38.1/11">Over the past few weeks, we have been able to draw on the UK's strength in public health and infectious disease control to deal with the threats posed by SARS. I must stress, however, that this is an evolving situation. We are keeping our plans and policies constantly under review, learning lessons where they need to be learned, building on good ideas wherever they are to be found and, especially, tracking the disease very closely in collaboration with our counterparts in other countries throughout the world. For example, this week we sent an expert from the HPA to Canada to assist, but at the same time to learn as much as possible from the unfortunate events in Toronto so that we can build the lessons learned there into our own plans here.</p> <p pid=".38.1/12">So far, the approach taken on dealing with SARS in this country has proven effective. There is, however, no room for complacency. My clinical and scientific advisers have stressed that we need to retain flexibility in how we respond, not least because we do not yet fully understand how SARS spreads. We do know that most of the cases have been transmitted between people who were in close contact with one another&#8212;for example between health care workers and SARS patients&#8212;rather than through normal social contact among the wider population. However, we cannot at this stage reliably predict whether the SARS virus will maintain its current pattern of attack, change in infectivity or find new routes of transmission. That is why it is so important to strike a balance on how we respond to it.</p> <p pid=".38.1/13">Some have asked why we do not adopt a policy of screening all entrants to the United Kingdom from countries that have had cases of SARS. The problem is that there is no such test. Screening involves asking people a series of questions about their health to identify any signs or suspicious symptoms. That is being done, according to WHO advice, at airports in the areas most affected.</p> <p pid=".38.1/14">I am advised, however, that the early signs and symptoms of SARS occur commonly in the general population and are associated with a cough, cold or minor viral infection. Air travel, with its propensity to induce dry throats and coughs, is also a potential source of a large number of false leads, so trying to identify a genuine case of SARS is, as the CMO has put it, like looking for a needle in a haystack. With 4 million British and other visitors travelling between this country and the most affected areas each year, quarantining all those with such non-specific symptoms would be simply impractical. Indeed, I have been advised by our scientific experts that none of the six probable cases of SARS so far identified in this country would have been prevented or detected by screening at points of exit or entry, and still less on aircraft themselves. Instead, each case was picked up because of the patient's awareness of SARS and, of course, because of the high level of awareness among NHS staff.</p> <p pid=".38.1/15">Fortunately, the evidence so far is that people transit SARS only once they have symptoms of the disease, and not before. With a disease incubation period of up to 10 days, successful identification and treatment of SARS sufferers has so far been achieved by concentrating public health expertise on people who have returned to this country and developed the disease in the succeeding days. However, this is a changing situation globally and if our experts advise changes to our approach, we will not hesitate to introduce new measures.</p> <p pid=".38.1/16">Others have asked why we do not make SARS a notifiable disease. In this early and important stage of the SARS outbreak it is vital that we find out about all cases of the disease through rapid notification of cases rather than through the slow and bureaucratic processes associated with the notifiable disease regime. Unfortunately, that regime has become associated with significant under-reporting of disease. In any case, it is extraordinarily unusual for a person in this country suffering from an infectious disease to refuse treatment, reject advice and persuasion and necessitate calling the police compulsorily to detain them. We do not foresee that that power will be necessary in detaining people who fall ill with SARS at this stage.</p> <p pid=".38.1/17">For the benefit of the House, however, I should mention that the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public_Health">Public Health</a> (Aircraft) Regulations 1979 do provide the power to detain for examination any person leaving an aircraft where there are reasonable grounds for suspecting that they are suffering from or have been exposed to infection. The Public Health (Ships) Regulations 1979 contain a similar provision. I can tell the House that should the CMO advise me that wider powers have become necessary, SARS will be made notifiable. I am advised that, if necessary, we could make it so within 48 hours.</p> <p pid=".38.1/18">We remain vigilant to the threat posed by SARS to public health in our country, so I can also tell the House today that I am taking further action following advice from the CMO. First, following emerging evidence from the main affected areas that SARS spreads through poor cross-infection control measures, all chief executives of NHS organisations are being reminded to ensure that rigorous controls are in place when treating a patient with possible SARS. That communication will also include an instruction to defer the start date of appointments of any foreign recruits to the NHS from SARS-affected areas.</p> <p pid=".38.1/19">Secondly, I am taking steps to check that the exit screening from ports of departure is indeed robust. <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_UK">The UK</a> is this week sending observers to those areas to ensure that passengers are being screened in line with WHO guidance. Where we have doubts that that is the case, we will consider screening passengers on specific flights on entry to Britain, including asking them to make a signed declaration that they have not been in close contact with SARS cases and do not have symptoms themselves.</p> <p pid=".38.1/20">Thirdly, I intend with my right hon. Friend the <a href="/glossary/?gl=23" title="Secretary of State was originally the title given to the two officials who..." class="glossary">Secretary of State</a> for Transport to ask airlines returning passengers from SARS-affected areas to distribute information along with boarding cards. We also intend to discuss with the airlines other means of informing passengers about SARS on all long-haul flights from affected areas.</p> <p pid=".38.1/21">Fourthly, I remind all airlines of their obligations to provide a declaration of health when a plane arrives in this country.</p> <p pid=".38.1/22">Fifthly, next month at the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Health_Assembly">World Health Assembly</a> in Geneva, I will meet other Health Ministers to discuss whether any further measures above and beyond those already taken could be put in place at a European or international level.</p> <p pid=".38.1/23">The whole House will want to pay tribute to staff in the NHS for their prompt, effective and successful action in responding to SARS. The best advice that I have is that the UK, alongside many other countries that have experienced a very low incidence of SARS to date, may see further cases over the months ahead. Given the importance and ease of global travel, we cannot isolate ourselves from the rest of the world. Given the complexity of detection, the test of success of our disease control policy rests on keeping to an absolute minimum the spread of the disease and successfully treating those affected.</p> <p pid=".38.1/24">To date, the NHS has met that challenge because of the precautionary but proportionate approach that has been taken. We will continue to be vigilant, we will take whatever means are necessary to safeguard the public health of our people and we will continue working with the international community to tackle and, in time, defeat this serious new disease.</p>            </div>

                                  <div class="debate-speech__content">                <p pid=".41.0/1">I am grateful to the <a href="/glossary/?gl=23" title="Secretary of State was originally the title given to the two officials who..." class="glossary">Secretary of State</a> for his statement and I thank him for making it available to the <a href="/glossary/?gl=29" title="The Opposition are the political parties in the House of Commons other than..." class="glossary">Opposition</a> in advance.</p> <p pid=".41.0/2">He is absolutely right in the main thrust of his comments about the present situation in the United Kingdom. We are fortunate, especially given the amount of passenger traffic coming into the United Kingdom, that we have not had more cases of <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SARS">SARS</a>, as has happened in <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hong_Kong">Hong Kong</a> and China. The staff who have looked after the cases in this country are to be congratulated on that. The question is, however, whether we are doing all that we can to keep it that way.</p> <p pid=".41.0/3">I am sure that the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secretary_of_State">Secretary of State</a> would be the first to agree that reports that the worst is over might lead to complacency, which would be highly regrettable. The outbreak in China is still gathering pace and is certainly not contained. If we look at the measures that have been taken in Asia over the past few days, we see that Taiwan has imposed a two-week ban on the entry of visitors from badly affected areas after the island announced its first SARS death on Saturday, that <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Korea">South Korea</a> and the Philippines are taking new measures, and that in Singapore, although cases are declining with the imposition of stringent measures, including thermal imaging of air passengers, the quarantine regulations are being strictly enforced. To those who say that those Governments are going over the top, I point out that the director general of the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WHO">WHO</a> said this morning that such measures are not over the top, but prudent and necessary.</p> <p pid=".41.0/4"><a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Secretary">The Secretary</a> of State said that we have had just six probable cases in the UK. Are any suspected or probable cases being investigated at the present time? If so, how many?</p> <p pid=".41.0/5">The issue on which I have the greatest disagreement with the Secretary of State is that of the notifiability of the disease. He says that it is extraordinarily unusual for a person in this country to reject advice and persuasion and to require detention. That is, of course, correct, but his approach is based on the presumption that somebody who is unwell with a high fever will act rationally. He says that if the situation gets worse, the Government will make it a notifiable disease, but, by his argument, they will do so only if the processes that have already been put in place have failed. The 1979 regulations that he mentions are inadequate, because they allow only for individuals to be detained for examination: they do not require someone to be quarantined and treated. Why are the Government denying the protection that the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public_Health">Public Health</a> (Control of Disease) Act 1984 was introduced to provide? It is pointless to say that if the situation gets worse we will use the powers that we already have, as we should be using them to ensure that it does not arise in the first place.</p> <p pid=".41.0/6">I welcome what the Secretary of State said about increased information for passengers&#8212;that should have been done long before now&#8212;but I wonder whether the checks that are supposedly taking place at airports of departure are really taking place. I can say from my own experience that when I recently passed through Singapore as a passenger I was not given proper information about what would be happening in relation to SARS.</p> <p pid=".41.0/7">May I ask the Secretary of State about one or two of the measures that he proposes to introduce? He says that he will defer the start date for those coming into the United Kingdom to work in the NHS. For how long will he do so, and how will that be determined? Will that measure be kept in place until the entire SARS outbreak is under control? He says that if we send observers to airports of departure and they see that checks are not being made, he will ask for a declaration from passengers that they have not been in contact with SARS and do not have the symptoms of SARS. How will people who have been in Hong Kong or Singapore know whether they have been in contact with someone who has had SARS? That makes such a declaration utterly meaningless.</p> <p pid=".41.0/8">I am sure that the Secretary of State's officials looked at all the tests that could be of assistance, given that he said that we may find that passengers are not being properly screened before arriving back in the United Kingdom. For example, what advice has he received from his officials about using an actin serum screening test, which was originally developed as a screening test for blood transfusion, to act as an early marker for infection of donated blood?</p> <p pid=".41.0/9">It is used widely in Belgium and Germany. Someone who contracts a virus has an increased rate of apoptosis&#8212;more cell death&#8212;which produces actin fragments in the blood stream. Although it is non-specific, it becomes positive during the incubation period. Will the Secretary of State and his scientific advisers re-examine the experience of the use of the test and its possible application in the case of the failure of policies in airports to which he referred? We should use everything at our disposal to maximise public safety.</p> <p pid=".41.0/10">The judgment is not whether all that needs to be done but whether all that can be done is being done. The last thing we want is an increase in the number of cases when we could have taken action to prevent that.</p>            </div>

                                  <div class="debate-speech__content">                <p pid=".43.0/1">I thank the hon. Gentleman for his comments and questions. He said that we were fortunate not to have more cases in this country. I believe that it is a not question of good fortune but of good policy, good judgment and, most important, the action of the NHS and our public health services in this country. We are extremely fortunate to have one of the best public health systems in the world. The hon. Gentleman is aware of that and the measures that have been taken in the past few years to strengthen that system, most notably the creation of the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health_Protection_Agency">Health Protection Agency</a>. Steps have also been taken to strengthen public health powers locally through primary care trusts and regionally through the appointment of directors of public health.</p> <p pid=".43.0/2">The hon. Gentleman asserted that the spread of <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SARS">SARS</a> was gathering pace. He should be cautious. Before I came to the House, I heard the latest advice from the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WHO">WHO</a>. It said that although there were major anxieties about China, it was pleased with progress in other countries, notably Singapore and Vietnam. It is important to maintain a sense of perspective and proportion. Otherwise, we simply will not get the policy right. The hon. Gentleman and I want to get it right.</p> <p pid=".43.0/3">The hon. Gentleman asked about the number of suspected cases as distinct from probable cases. The WHO has advised that we should try to identify the numbers of suspected cases and probable cases. In the latter, the balance of probability is in favour of the presence of a SARS infection. At this time of year in the part of south-east Asia that we are considering, there is a high incidence of flu-like illnesses alongside the new and emerging infection of SARS. It is therefore unsurprising that some people who return from those countries report symptoms that could be a cough, a cold, flu or, in the worst case, SARS. To date, about 50 suspected cases have been investigated and dismissed. The number of definite probable cases remains six.</p> <p pid=".43.0/4">The hon. Gentleman mentioned notifiability and considered whether the powers under the 1979 aircraft and ship regulations give us powers that he claimed that we did not have. Our lawyers advise me that we have precisely the powers that we need both to take people off a plane and ensure their hospitalisation.</p> <p pid=".43.0/5">I have taken clinical and scientific advice about the start date for new staff. We are proposing a 14-day breathing period to the NHS. Again, that is a precautionary approach given that the incubation period for SARS appears to be two to seven days or perhaps 10 days.</p> <p pid=".43.0/6">The hon. Gentleman asked whether the declaration from passengers would mean anything if we took that route. He will find on examination that that is being done in other countries. I am not sure whether it is done in the United States but, for example, <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Air_France">Air France</a> has adopted such a policy. It is important to get some indication in the absence of any screening test.The hon. Gentleman knows the science as well as I do. There is currently no diagnostic test.</p> <p pid=".43.0/7">There is no blood or urine test to detect whether a person has SARS. The only screening that can be undertaken is to ask people some questions, and that is precisely what we propose to do.</p> <p pid=".43.0/8">I should have thought that the hon. Gentleman, who has been droning on on the radio and on television over the past few days, although thankfully he kept his remarks to a minimum today, would welcome the measures that we are taking because they are precisely in line with the precautionary but proportionate approach that is necessary.</p> <p pid=".43.0/9">The proof of the pudding will be in the eating, but what the hon. Gentleman cannot get away from is that, despite the many visitors that we have each and every week from those areas that have been affected by this appalling new SARS virus, the cases that have presented, precisely because of the precautionary and proportionate approach that has been put in place, number just six. That is not a ground for complacency, but it is the foundation on which we seek to build, and it is important that we do so on the basis of the best scientific and clinical advice and avoid the situation that we have seen in previous public health scares, including those under his Administration, where it is politicians who decide the course of clinical and scientific policy.</p>            </div>

We share the concern of the House about the potential impact of the epidemic, not only on Britain's public health and on the well-being of world economies, but particularly on populations in developing countries that have neither the hospitals nor the public health structures adequately to treat the infection or to contain its spread. In that respect, reports of cases in India now are extremely worrying.</p> <p pid=".45.0/2"><a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liberal_Democrats">Liberal Democrats</a> believe, as I think does the <a href="/glossary/?gl=35" title="Ministers make up the Government and almost all are members of the House of..." class="glossary">Minister</a>, that in public health matters it is important to take advice from professionals and from the science base, which is now global. But is it not also incumbent on Ministers, when formulating policy to tackle an epidemic such as this to set out the detail of the advice and the reasons why those decisions have been taken?</p> <p pid=".45.0/3">For example, with regard to the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MMR">MMR</a> vaccine, the right hon. Gentleman will know that Liberal Democrats have no criticism of Ministers' decisions, nor of the way in which they explained precisely why they took such an approach, but does he understand why it is difficult for those of us who broadly support the Government's approach to understand why Ministers do not take the opportunity now to require <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SARS">SARS</a> to be notified in order to give environmental health departments and hospital authorities reserve powers to insist on compliance with public health authorities? He needs to explain why that is not happening.</p> <p pid=".45.0/4"><a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Minister">The Minister</a> with responsibility for public health has merely cited the chief medical officer's advice, without setting out the evidence and reasons for it. Given the potential seriousness of a UK outbreak, does the <a href="/glossary/?gl=23" title="Secretary of State was originally the title given to the two officials who..." class="glossary">Secretary of State</a> accept that claiming that notification would be too bureaucratic is not a satisfactory reason for not making the disease notifiable and providing those powers? Is it not the case that the so-called bureaucratic system of reporting need not replace the current system? If the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secretary_of_State">Secretary of State</a> believes that the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public_Health">Public Health</a> (Control of Disease) Act 1984 is unwieldy, does he not agree that it is regrettable that successive Governments have not followed the advice of the chief medical officers, given in 1988 and more recently, to update that legislation?</p> <p pid=".45.0/5">On airport screening, does the Secretary of State accept that, while <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Health_Organisation">World Health Organisation</a> guidance recommends screening at the airport of departure, it does not advise against screening at the airport of arrival? Would it not be appropriate to use our immigration and entry system to provide the information needed and, possibly, to provide temperature screening? Will he also explain what advice he has had from the chief medical officer on asking passengers to sign forms when they might not even have the language skills to do so? No clinician would take such an approach, as such action would require a consultation.</p> <p pid=".45.0/6">Does the Secretary of State agree that the isolation of asymptomatic people&#8212;even if they have passed through Singapore, as <a href="/mp/?m=899" title="Our page on Liam Fox - 'the hon. Member for Woodspring (Dr. Fox)'">Dr. Fox</a> has done&#8212;is, as the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CMO">CMO</a> advises, unnecessary? It could be counter-productive, as it could lead to unjustified discrimination and stigma, and might deter people with symptoms from coming forward. This problem is going to be with us for months, at best, and probably for years. The worst-case scenario is that it could affect the world for decades. <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_House">The House</a> must revisit the problem, and I hope that the Secretary of State will take the opportunity of forthcoming health legislation to provide the framework to update our public health legislation in the way that has been recommended serially by chief medical officers over the last 14 years.</p>            </div>

First, on the modernisation of public health legislation, the chief medical officer made recommendations to us about modernising the notifiable disease framework within a broader context, and I have some sympathy for them. We shall obviously keep that issue under review. The second point that the hon. Gentleman made, which is extremely important in dealing with these issues, is that while our action must be proportionate, it must also be based on the best scientific and clinical advice that we can get. There are good reasons for that. Anyone who remembers the outbreaks of bovine spongiform encephalopathy and variant <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CJD">CJD</a> will know how important it is for Ministers not to give false assurances from the <a href="/glossary/?gl=171" title="If you've ever seen inside the Commons, you'll notice a large table in the..." class="glossary">Dispatch Box</a>, but to rely in as open and transparent a way as possible on the best scientific and clinical advice that we can get, precisely so that we can take a precautionary and proportionate approach.</p>            </div>

The virus, particularly in its early presentation, shares many symptoms with coughs, colds and other viral infections. There is not a simple test. If there were, we would put it in place, as would Governments throughout the world. I am sure that the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WHO">WHO</a> would quickly advise us to do so. The only screening that we can do is to try to ascertain from passengers coming from <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SARS">SARS</a>-affected areas whether they have been in contact with the disease. I realise that that is far from perfect, but the hon. Gentleman must understand that this is a new and emerging infection, that we are trying to learn as we go, and that the best scientific experts in this country and throughout the world are being deployed on that task.</p> <p pid=".47.4/2">The hon. Gentleman said that he was neither satisfied nor reassured by my statement. I accept that he has a view about that. However, if he is not prepared to believe me, I hope that he will believe some of the leading scientific and clinical experts in this country. <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Professor_Roy_Anderson">Professor Roy Anderson</a>, who is a leading epidemiologist from Imperial college in London, was interviewed by <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Humphrys">John Humphrys</a> on the "Today" programme on Saturday. John Humphrys asked:</p> <p class="indent" pid=".47.4/3">"Professor Anderson, are we sufficiently on top of this one do you think?"</p> <p pid=".47.4/4">Professor Anderson replied:</p> <p class="indent" pid=".47.4/5">"I think so, yes. I think the sort of doom and gloom predictions have been rather exaggerated. This is not a highly transmissible infection. It's been effectively contained in most of the developed countries in the world with very limited number of cases, Britain being a good example".</p>            </div>

As the hon. Gentleman must be aware, under-reporting has got progressively worse, rather than better, over many years. However, he will also know from the variant <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Creutzfeldt-Jakob">Creutzfeldt-Jakob</a> disease episode that other systems of reporting can be at least as effective&#8212;they are often more effective&#8212;as the official disease notification system. Indeed, to the best of our knowledge, at least, vCJD is almost 100 per cent. successfully reported. All of the cases that are identified are properly reported.</p> <p pid=".49.2/2">The hon. Gentleman will share my desire&#8212;particularly in the early phase of what is a serious outbreak of this disease&#8212;that all cases be reported as quickly as possible with the minimum of bureaucracy, and that is what is happening. Cases are being reported directly to the chief medical officer and also to the new <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health_Protection_Agency">Health Protection Agency</a>, rather than going through the form-filling exercise of which the hon.

Gentleman was present during my statement and he knows full well that I did not say that. I said that if I received advice from the chief medical officer that further powers were necessary, on top of those already available in legislation through the 1979 regulations, we would not hesitate to take them. However, I hope that the hon. Gentleman agrees that it is important to take decisions on the basis of the best clinical and scientific advice, which is what we will continue to do. The fact that we have done so to date is one of the reasons why we have so few <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SARS">SARS</a> cases in this country so far, and we shall continue to adopt the same approach in the weeks and months to come.</p>            </div>

He reminded us that in the course of a day, 3,000 children die of malaria worldwide; that nearly 3 million more people will have died of tuberculosis by the end of 2003; that 40 million people have died from <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AIDS">AIDS</a>; and that in the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/USA">USA</a>, ordinary influenza kills between 20,000 and 30,000 people each and every year. There are also several thousand such deaths in this country alone. However, that is not to downplay in any way the significance of a new and serious illness.</p> <p pid=".50.3/2">My right hon.

It is not simply a question of hand washing; probable <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SARS">SARS</a> cases will need to be treated in an isolated environment. The <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WHO">WHO</a> recommends barrier nursing.
