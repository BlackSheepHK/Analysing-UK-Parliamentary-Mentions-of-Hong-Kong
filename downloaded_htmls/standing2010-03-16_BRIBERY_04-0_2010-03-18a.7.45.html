We have already touched on the difficulty businesses face in complying with the clauses relating to corporate responsibility and adequate procedures, the problems of ongoing compliance monitoring and the need for a system that changes current attitudes and in so doing encourages companies to come forward and report corruption.</p> <p>Plans to update and rework this patchwork of antiquated <a href="/glossary/?gl=38" title="Laws are the rules by which a country is governed. Britain has a long..." class="glossary">laws</a> have been mooted since the mid 1970s with the Salmon Commission reporting in 1976. The <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nolan_Committee">Nolan Committee</a> followed in 1995 and ushered in an era characterised by international pressure to reform and rationalise the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UK">UK</a>s corruption laws. International obligations arising from agreements with the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OECD">OECD</a>, the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/EU">EU</a> and the UN have increased pressure on the UK to develop common standards at an international level for its anti-corruption measures.</p> <p>Over recent years the UK, as has been mentioned by many hon. Members, has seen its international reputation on matters of bribery diminished as a consequence of criticism of the robustness of our domestic procedures and processes on corruption, not to mention the publicity generated by the crimes of some companies. British business has traditionally been a bastion of fairness and propriety in its dealings overseas.</p> <p>Despite required changes to the law in practice it is also important to recognise the good practice in British business and the desire of most British business men to do the right thing. However, we need to recognise that the OECD in particular has been forthright in its criticism of the UK stating in October 2008 that it was</p> <p class="indent">disappointed and seriously concerned about the UKs continued failure to address deficiencies in its laws on bribery</p> <p>I should like to make some comparisons with other jurisdictions on this specific point. One aspect that I want to discuss is how some other jurisdictions have been faster on the uptake when it has come to amending their bribery laws. One facet of those laws has been the provisions of independent bodies to assist bodies on matters pertaining to bribery laws. <span class="hi"><a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hong_Kong">Hong Kong</a></span>, for instance, has the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Independent_Commission_Against_Corruption">Independent Commission Against Corruption</a> and the Corruption Prevention Departments advisory services group, which was created in 1986.</p> <p>Since its inception, the group has advised some 3,000 private companies. It provides tailor-made corruption prevention advice on systems or internal control. It also assists companies in drawing up staff codes of conduct and in particular a policy on solicitation and acceptance of advantages, a policy on acceptance of entertainment, guidelines on declarations of conflicts of interests and guidelines on handling confidential information. Any company can go along to the advisory services group and seek its free advice on the adequacy of the systems and procedures that it has drawn up.</p> <p>This advisory services group also formulates and distributes codes of industry best practice and organises talks and seminars to promote them. Lord Thomas in the <a href="/glossary/?gl=129" title="The House of Lords. When used in the House of Lords, this phrase refers to..." class="glossary">other place</a> was a vociferous exponent of the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ICAC">ICAC</a> quoting two impressive sources. The first was the chairman of the <span class="hi">Hong Kong</span> Institute of Directors, Mr Herbert Hui, who said:</p> <p class="indent">Directors are entrusted with the execution of corporate governance standards within each corporation, listed company, SME or <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NGO">NGO</a>. The Advisory Services Group of the Corruption Prevention Department assists corporations to enhance corporate governance standards from a corruption prevention point of view. We highly recommend directors of corporations to make use of the Group's free and professional consultancy services.</p> <p>The director and chief executive of Cathay Pacific Airways Limited, Mr Philip Chen, said:</p> <p class="indent">Since its establishment in 1985, the Advisory Services Group of the Corruption Prevention Department has been conscientiously assisting private sector companies in enhancing system controls and promoting to staff the importance of corruption prevention. In the past, we had sought advice from the Group on various parts of our operation. I highly value the Group's work and contributions to the community.[<span class="italic">Official Report, <a href="/glossary/?gl=191" title="The house of Lords is the upper chamber of the Houses of Parliament. It is..." class="glossary">House of Lords</a>, </span>7 January 2010; Vol. 716, c. GC62.]</p> <p>Both Lord Mackay and the Earl of Onslow joined Lord Thomas in supporting the provision for an advisory service.</p> <p>In the United States, the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/US_Attorney-General">US Attorney-General</a> is required under the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act 1977 to provide an advisory service whose remit is to respond to requests about whether a proposed action will be lawful. In the US, there is a rebuttable presumption that acting in accordance with the advice of the service will mean that no offence has been committed.</p> <p>We have heard a number of mixed views on the issue of an advisory service for the UK. On the whole, business was very much in favour of having such a service, no doubt deriving from its experience of the operations of the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Takeover_Panel">Takeover Panel</a> and the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Competition_Commission">Competition Commission</a>, which provide a similar service in other corporate spheres. For instance, Philip Bramwell of BAE Systems said of an advisory service:</p> <p class="indent">This is of immense value to companies looking for certainty about how conduct would be treated and about the efficacy of their proposed approach to compliance. It is especially useful around mergers and acquisitions and new businesses that may have an uncertain history.</p>            </div>

                                  <div class="debate-speech__content">                <p> My hon. Friend makes a pertinent point. Smaller companies that move up the scale and start trading in developing countries will have to take a big leap of faith and look for advice. Huge costs are often involved in small companies doing their first deal, so an advisory service could be very helpful to them. <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_ICC">The ICC</a> differentiates between informal and formal advice, but I will return to that topic later.</p> <p>The ICC highlighted the ancillary benefits that such a service would bring. It stated that the inevitable preliminary discussions that could lead to an application for advice would enhance the dialogue between companies and the authorities, increase efficiency and usefully provide for an accessible body of jurisprudence. As the ICC notes, such a system operates successfully in the US, where the provision of clear and responsive rulings enables US businesses to compete in international markets. Is that not the exact environment that we wish to create for British business?</p> <p>Professor Horder expressed support for the idea in his evidence to the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joint_Committee">Joint Committee</a>, saying:</p> <p class="indent">if I could start from a slightly different view, were we to have in this country an anti-bribery body, a commission, a semi-official body of some sort, charged with giving this kind of advice I could well see as being appropriate...Were we to have somebody charged with giving advice of this kind I think that would be very much of benefit both publicly and to companies and would give them reassurance.</p> <p>One distinction must be drawn out at this stage. The new <a href="/glossary/?gl=98" title="A parliamentary bill is divided into sections called clauses.    Printed in..." class="glossary">clause</a> provides for a service that is focused on compliance procedures and is aimed at minimising the risk of corruption, rather than the risk of prosecution arising from a particular action. One thinks of the takeover panels no names advisory service, of which I have a great deal of first-hand experience and which can prove exceptionally useful to all parties concerned in commercial transactions.</p> <p>We accept that the US system is inherently different from the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UK">UK</a>s and that, as noted in the Joint Committee report, there are concerns about the independence of prosecutors. With the new clauses, we are calling for more thought to be given to the provision of a British version of the US system that is sympathetic to the aims of the Bill and the intricacies of the UKs justice system. Much has been said about the need to change corporate culture and the general attitude to bribery. Much has also been said about the inherent problem of prosecuting crimes of corruption because of the lack of sufficient evidence to bring a case. <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lord_Thomas_of_Gresford">Lord Thomas of Gresford</a> made that point concisely in the <a href="/glossary/?gl=129" title="The House of Lords. When used in the House of Lords, this phrase refers to..." class="glossary">other place</a> when dealing with <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lord_Tunnicliffe">Lord Tunnicliffe</a>s response on the Governments position, which relies heavily on the prosecutorial concerns put forward by the Director of Public Prosecutions and the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Serious_Fraud_Office">Serious Fraud Office</a>. Lord Thomas said:</p> <p class="indent">I want the Government to take a different view, and to step back and look again at the benefits that the Joint Committee did not have time to investigate. I want them to consider whether this is an idea that they should take up and provide the sort of advice to companies that they clearly want.[<span class="italic">Official Report, <a href="/glossary/?gl=191" title="The house of Lords is the upper chamber of the Houses of Parliament. It is..." class="glossary">House of Lords</a>, </span>7 January 2010; Vol. 716, c. GC65.]</p> <p>We see the advisory service as an amalgamation of all the aims of the Bill and a response to all the inherent difficulties that we have outlined in the Committee. Such an organisation could monitor compliance, ensure adherence, guide businesses through the potential minefield of offences and encourage early disclosure of suspect practices.</p> <p>To critics such as Professor Wells, who thought that the service would be an unnecessary public expense, I point to the possibility of fee charging, which is suggested in new clause 3. We do not necessarily want that, but it should be considered as an alternative if the only argument is that the service is a good idea but will cost too much money. If the companies had the opportunity to pay for advice, perhaps that would be better than them not having advice at all.</p>            </div>

                                  <div class="debate-speech__content">                <p> My hon. Friend makes a very good point about the net cost implication, rather than just immediate cost. If business wants the service and the comfort of knowing that they are complying with legislation, perhaps they should have the right to pay. If the appropriate balance could be struck, the fee could be set at a level that ensured that companies would not abuse the service as a clearance system for every action, however small, and that the service would be self-sustaining in the long run.</p> <p>The intention behind our proposals is to ensure that a company can rely on any advice from the advisory service as an evidential matter in a trial. The burden of proof will be on a company to say that it has adequate procedures. When proceedings were brought, if a company had gone to such a service and obtained advice, and was  relying on the advice that it received, it would be quickly apparent whether any offence had been committed. If a company could say in a letter to the prosecuting authority, We asked for advice; we got it and we followed it, I imagine, save in the most exceptional cases, that that would prevent a prosecution.</p> <p>It would seem that the Government, or rather Ministers in the <a href="/glossary/?gl=129" title="The House of Lords. When used in the House of Lords, this phrase refers to..." class="glossary">other place</a>, overlooked what already exists in the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UK">UK</a> to advise business. During various debates in the other place, they said that this was not our way of doing things. However, I refer the Under-Secretary to the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SFO">SFO</a> guidance entitled Approach of the SFO to dealing with overseas corruption, which came out only a few months ago. I am sure that she has read itit is a good read. It is not only helpful, but important to the debate, because it takes a slightly different approachan informal one rather than a formal oneand contains the exact same idea that a company should have someone whom it can approach.</p> <p>The guidance states:</p> <p class="indent">A number of corporates and professional advisers have told us that it would be very helpful to them if we were able to offer an opinion procedure concerning future enforcement activity along the lines offered by the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/US_Department_of_Justice">US Department of Justice</a>. We are sympathetic to this.</p> <p>That document came out well before the debates in the other place. However, it was not mentioned there, which was a staggering omission. It continues:</p> <p class="indent">The circumstances in which this procedure will be appropriate will need to be discussed but we are ready to offer assistance in one type of case which corporates have mentioned to us. This is where a group (A) is proposing to take over another group (B) and, during due diligence, discovers overseas corruption issues in (B). (A) is committed to a modern ethical corporate culture and, if the transaction goes ahead, would take the necessary remedial action in respect of what has happened. (A) wishes to know what our approach would be.</p> <p class="indent">We appreciate the need for help in the circumstances and will give (A) assurances about our action. These assurances could be that no action will take place provided that (A) takes the remedial action it has told us that it will take if the takeover goes ahead. Alternatively, if we find that the corruption is long lasting and systemic, we might say that we would consider a criminal investigation whether at the corporate or individual level.</p> <p class="indent">We appreciate that these issues are often likely to be very confidential and price sensitive. We would anticipate that professional advisers would want to discuss a possible approach with the SFO before it was actually made.</p> <p class="indent">Corporates have also asked for guidance on how we would apply the offence in the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bribery_Bill">Bribery Bill</a> of negligently failing to prevent bribery. We welcome the opportunity to discuss our approach with corporates. We can discuss our general approach, which is to focus very much on changes of behaviour so far as possible in order to promote a modern corporate culture. Our emphasis is on helping corporates to develop this culture and to use enforcement action only where this is necessary and proportionate.</p> <p>That is helpful, and I am pleased to be able to put it on record. The document continues:</p> <p class="indent">In any discussions about procedures within the corporate we shall be looking to find evidence of adequate procedures to assess how successful the corporate has been in mitigating risk. We shall also be looking closely at the culture within the corporate to see how well the processes really reflect what is happening in the corporate. For example, we shall look for the following.</p>            </div>

I was going to ask the Under-Secretary to put on record her Departments approach on the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SFO">SFO</a> guidance, which it has not discussed to date. However, that is the approach of only one of the prosecuting authorities, and others might have their own approaches.</p> <p>I could ask why the SFO is shooting off on its own, without going through the Government or other prosecuting authorities, but I will certainly not do that because that approach is exactly the type of proactive, helpful and forward-thinking initiative that we want from our prosecutors, and I have personally congratulated the SFO director on it. How does that fit with the narrow-minded approach on advice that, so far as we have heard, the Government have taken? They refuse to deal with any aspect of adviceformal, as proposed in our new <a href="/glossary/?gl=98" title="A parliamentary bill is divided into sections called clauses.    Printed in..." class="glossary">clause</a>, or informal, as the prosecuting authorities quite sensibly seem to be putting in place.

                                  <div class="debate-speech__content">                <p> My noble Friend <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lord_Thomas_of_Gresford">Lord Thomas of Gresford</a> made some fascinating remarks in the other  place about the <span class="hi"><a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hong_Kong">Hong Kong</a></span> system during an interesting debate that also covered the US. There is something there to be investigated and thought about carefully.</p> <p>What came out of the debate in the <a href="/glossary/?gl=129" title="The House of Lords. When used in the House of Lords, this phrase refers to..." class="glossary">other place</a> was that there were also disadvantages in other systems, as the hon. Member for Huntingdon was good enough to mention. One is the difference in attitude towards the independence of prosecutors here and elsewhere. There are problems with prosecutors being seen to commit themselves in advance, with legal consequences that can be complicated and difficult.</p> <p>As for cost, I am not sure that simply charging a fee is a way round the problem. The cost has to lie somewhere, as such a system is expensive to set up. In addition, the advisory service in <span class="hi">Hong Kong</span> is part of a very different system of dealing with corruption, which includes ferocious procedural rules about what will happen to people who fall foul of the system. I suspect that the deterrent effect of those rules explains some of the success in <span class="hi">Hong Kong</span>.</p> <p>My view is that new <a href="/glossary/?gl=98" title="A parliamentary bill is divided into sections called clauses.    Printed in..." class="glossary">clause</a> 2 is very good apart from its use of the word shall. It would make a lot more sense if that word were may. That would mean that a service could be put in place if the relevant Government Department chose to go down that route because, after further study, it was decided on balance that that was the right thing to do. There is a lot more work to do, however, especially on the detail of how the system would work procedurally and constitutionally, and not just on cost.</p>            </div>

                                  <div class="debate-speech__content">                <p> I have one or two things that I want to say in support of the new clauses, which are worth while and worth adding to the Bill. The first is the general point that this is an important area of new law. We are breaking new ground, as we have said, and it is reasonable to expect some assistance for those companies that will be affected. I will not revisit our earlier argument ant guidance but, to some extent, it overlaps with this issue.</p> <p>The arguments that the Under-Secretary made on guidance were that the Government do not wish to catch companies out and do not intend to increase the  number of prosecutions. They wish to send out the right messages and ensure that companies avoid bribery so that cases do not reach the prosecution stage, which is entirely the right approach. The guidance is there to offer businesses what assistance the Government can to understand what they should, and should not, do and avoid the possibility of prosecution.</p> <p>The Under-Secretary made the perfectly reasonable point that, in guidance, we cannot anticipate every conceivable circumstance and outline every conceivable case. That is reasonable, but the answer is not necessarily to fall back, as we know, on prosecutorial discretion without other assistance. However, if we cannot assume that we know the circumstances of every conceivable case, the answer might be to ask, why not supplement the guidance with the offer of specific assistance? A company could go to the advisory service and say, Please assist in the specific circumstances that I face and explain what I should do in these circumstances. We recognise that the guidance cannot cover every eventuality, so we should supplement it with specific assistance when it is requested. There is therefore a good case for offering clarity to those likely to be affected by the legislation, partly with guidance and partly by supplementing that guidance with specific advice on the facts of the case.</p> <p>The point I made to my hon. Friend the Member for Huntingdon in an <a href="/glossary/?gl=39" title="An intervention is when the MP making a speech is interrupted by another MP..." class="glossary">intervention</a> is also relevant. Although I accept the point made by the hon. Member for Cambridge that there will inevitably be a cost in setting up any such advisory agency, over time that will be offset by the avoidance of prosecutions, I hope, in a great many cases. Businesses could say, I do not understand what I should do and whether I will lay myself open prosecution if I take a particular course of action, so I will seek advice and, having taken that advice, avoid that prosecution. In such circumstances, the taxpayer will make a significant saving through the prosecution not occurring in the first place, and the basic running costs of the advisory agency will be covered by the fee set out in new <a href="/glossary/?gl=98" title="A parliamentary bill is divided into sections called clauses.    Printed in..." class="glossary">clause</a> 3.</p> <p>Not only would the service be financially neutral, but it would be potentially advantageous, certainly in the longer term. In the end, this is a question of fulfilling the objective that the Government have set out for the legislation, which is not necessarily to prosecute more people but to ensure that those involved in businesses that may come into contact with bribery of various kinds understand what they have to do, can get the information they need to take the right course of action and, therefore, avoid being prosecuted. The clarity that the advisory service could offer will assist in that objective.</p>            </div>

                                  <div class="debate-speech__content">                <p> Advisory services are always extremely useful. The Government had a scheme to help people with mortgage difficulties. It was not successful in terms of the number of people who were helped but, when I talked to the Council of Mortgage Lenders, I realised that it was successful in that it put people in touch with their mortgage lender because they got help from them after they asked about the scheme.</p> <p>Many people who are going to do business abroad contact their chamber of commerce and the various exporting organisations, and are given a checklist or a  list of organisations that can help on a range of things to do with credit, banking and so on. An advisory organisation from which they would get some advice about the pitfalls of bribery and about the culture in certain areas would be very useful, simply because it would be on the checklist of organisations that a firm or partnership would want to talk to before they went abroad. Problems often occur when people do not understand the culture of a country and they find that they are manoeuvred into a situation that they did not expect.</p> <p>If the point of the Bill is deterrence, to ensure that people do not go down a particular route, an advisory service would be very useful for the Government. If there were several hundred companies going to a particular part of the world to sell their products, and they were all asking questions about certain practices or concerns, that would be an important pointer for that organisation to feed intelligence back to the prosecuting agencies about particular things that they ought to be very much aware of. Indeed, they would get a lot of people phoning and raising concerns that would be helpful in advising companies and also the Government and agencies. I think that that would be useful.</p> <p>I am not sure about charging for advice. As my hon. Friend the Member for Huntingdon pointed out, there will be substantial savings if companies are kept on the straight and narrow and not pulled into the ambit of legal problems. Moreover, the success of some advice services does not come in response to formal queries in which, as he pointed out, someone says, Im Mr. Smith from Warwick, Leamington Spa or wherever and I have a particular problem. It arises when people phone up without saying who they are, and raise a concern at the first point of contact. Someone can phone an organisation such as <a href="/glossary/?gl=76" title="http://www.acas.co.uk/" class="glossary">ACAS</a> and not have to say who they are; they can ask a general question about employment and it will provide guidance. If someone wants more specific advice, they have to say who they are, which is a good thing.</p> <p>I want to get back to the point I made in an <a href="/glossary/?gl=39" title="An intervention is when the MP making a speech is interrupted by another MP..." class="glossary">intervention</a> on my hon. Friend. If someone who is a cog in a business machine is worried about their job, their pension, their future, and they are being pressured or bullied to pursue a particular course of action by a manager, the fact that they can go to an independent advisory service to ask for advice, then perhaps pray in aid that advice within their corporate structure, is useful. It may be a useful tool for that individual to change the culture of the company or to be able to say to their managers, Ive got advice; it is contrary to what we are being told and I am very worried about it. My hon. Friend made a good point, which deserves serious consideration by the Government.</p>            </div>

                                  <div class="debate-speech__content">                <p> I have just two or three points to make. First, I welcome self-cleansing, as I mentioned earlier. It is a good thing that the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SFO">SFO</a> is the sort of guidance that my hon. Friend read out. Its offer of guidance is welcome and should be encouraged. Secondly, we must look at the position of small and medium-sized enterprises and the problem of defining them. If we look at a range of employment <a href="/glossary/?gl=38" title="Laws are the rules by which a country is governed. Britain has a long..." class="glossary">laws</a>the Governments gender pay audits apply where a business has 250 employees or more; there are other provisions where it is 50it is not entirely clear what an SME is. The guidance that the  Government will produce for <a href="/glossary/?gl=98" title="A parliamentary bill is divided into sections called clauses.    Printed in..." class="glossary">clause</a> 9 needs to consider that. The draft that has been produced says that further work is required, but I hope that it will be possible to provide guidance for individuals and individual companies so that they can simply ring up and get an answer or informal advice.</p> <p>It will be a great pity if SMEs find that there is not enough information in the written guidance and have to go to the type of agencies that my hon. Friend the Member for Poole mentioned, which give advice about bribery. However, there is always a danger with consultants and bodies of that type that people end up getting advice that is very cautious and requires a small business to do far more than is really necessary. We have seen that in the disability field on adaptations. Consultants suggest that walls be knocked down and great ramps put in, when in fact a small adaptation would be adequate. We have seen it happen with health and safety. It is important for small businesses that they have light-touch regulation and that they can discuss, with a proper Government source, exactly what it means so that they have an authoritative place to go.</p> <p>As for the position of the three directors, the SFO is happy to give advice, but is there a problem for the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DPP">DPP</a> and the director of Revenue and Customs Prosecution? Perhaps there is, because there are different cultures within the organisations. For example, <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HM_Revenue_and_Customs">HM Revenue and Customs</a> has a different approach from that of the DPP in how it negotiates with taxpayers. Perhaps the Under-Secretary can give us an idea of whether there is a problem between the three directors. If not, why not just say that the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Serious_Fraud_Office">Serious Fraud Office</a> will be the department that gives the advice? We would then have a willing department that knows what it is doing offering the advice. The others can say that it is the lead, just as it is in the investigation of the offences; in a way, problem solved. Whichever organisation is the advisory body, is its role to be involved in trade missions and say, along with the Under-Secretary and businesses, This is what we do in respect of anti-bribery?</p>            </div>

                                  <div class="debate-speech__content">                <p> The new clauses tabled by the hon. Member for Huntingdon would augment the generic guidance that we intend to provide under <a href="/glossary/?gl=98" title="A parliamentary bill is divided into sections called clauses.    Printed in..." class="glossary">clause</a> 9 with an advisory service that would provide bespoke advice to individual commercial organisations on a fee-paying basis. However, the nature of the proposed guidance is fundamentally different from that envisaged under clause 9, which will cover procedures that commercial organisations can put in place to prevent bribery. The advisory service envisaged by new clause 2 would enable commercial organisations to seek an official view on the adequacy of their procedures for the purposes of clause 7(2).</p> <p>There is an important and, indeed, fundamental difference between the two approaches. It is one thing for the Government to issue generic guidance about procedures that may be adopted to prevent bribery, but it is quite another to offer advice in individual cases on whether the procedures put in place are adequate. It is for the courtsnot a Departmentin the context of individual criminal proceedings to determine whether any given procedures are adequate for the purposes of clause 7(2).</p> <p>The hon. Member for Huntingdon made extensive reference to the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SFO">SFO</a> guidance, but that advice is limited to the narrow situation described in the guidance. In  reality, it is similar to the self-referral mechanisms that I mentioned earlierit does not amount to a general advisory service. The SFO director made it clear in his evidence to the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joint_Committee">Joint Committee</a> that a wider advisory service on a corporate offence would be unmanageable, because corporate organisations would want to obtain clearance for each transaction that took place about which they were worried to prevent further action. That would be unmanageable.</p>            </div>

It is not appropriate to make the comparisons. The advisory system that the hon. Gentleman proposes is quite similar to that of the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/US_Department_of_Justice">US Department of Justice</a> and the system that operates in <span class="hi"><a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hong_Kong">Hong Kong</a></span>.</p> <p>Those schemes were considered by the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joint_Committee">Joint Committee</a> on the draft <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bribery_Bill">Bribery Bill</a> and while I am aware that several witnesses from the business community indicated that they would like to see such an advisory service, that was not the view of the Joint Committee. It acknowledged that it might have some benefit, but it rejected the idea, noting that such schemes might prejudice the independence of prosecutors and were generally incompatible with our criminal justice system. That is the main point. Our criminal justice system is not the same as the US system, so it is wrong to make comparisons and to assume that one form of advisory service in the US would be appropriate to overlay on the UK justice system.</p>            </div>

Printed in..." class="glossary">clause</a> prevents the prosecutor from simply refusing to give the advice. But where the answer was rather more simple and helpful, it  could be given. It does not mean that a prosecutor or anyone else working in such an agency would have to give the kind of assistance about which she is concerned.</p>            </div>

A company would seek advice from the advisory organisation and if a prosecutor wished to pursue a case against it, the company would understandably wave in front of the prosecutor the advice from the advisory body, and argue that it must be clear. That limits right from the very start the prosecutions ability to look at all the matters and all the facts.</p> <p>The big difference is that unless the advisory service is given every essential fact and detail when it gives the advice, it is difficult and therefore inappropriate to tie the hands of the prosecutor. That was the main objection that was raised with the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joint_Committee">Joint Committee</a>, on which the hon. Member for Rugby and Kenilworth and the hon. Member for Huntingdon both served, and it was the main reason why it would not want to see an advisory service in place.</p>            </div>

That is not the same as the advice that TIUK or any other agency might provide about doing business abroadthat is quite different.

First, new <a href="/glossary/?gl=98" title="A parliamentary bill is divided into sections called clauses.    Printed in..." class="glossary">clause</a> 2 clearly sets out that any advice would be given without prejudice. In other words, a prosecution could still follow and everyone would have to understand that. Secondly, if a company seeks advice on what it should do, and it is given advice that it follows, yes, of course the point is to avoid prosecution. That was entirely in tune with everything the Under-Secretary has been saying in Committee. The objective is not necessarily to drag companies through the courts, but to ensure that they do what they should do to avoid bribery. The proposal is simply an extension of that.</p>            </div>

By providing guidance under <a href="/glossary/?gl=98" title="A parliamentary bill is divided into sections called clauses.    Printed in..." class="glossary">clause</a> 9, we recognise that it is important that businesses have an opportunity to consider what they need to do to put in place adequate procedures. That is why we are establishing the detail of the guidance, and we hope that businesses will take note of it.</p> <p>It would be wrong, however, for us to tie the hands of the prosecution authorities in the Bill and remove their discretion to look at all the facts of a case and decide what is appropriate. That goes hand in hand with the other clear message that we are sending as a result of the Bill: the need for self-referral. That is the right way to proceed. While <a href="/glossary/?gl=29" title="The Opposition are the political parties in the House of Commons other than..." class="glossary">Opposition</a> Members have expressed strong views and businesses have expressed an opinion, I do not believe that the new clause represents the right approach, so I trust that the hon.

There is all the talk about small businesses and how we want them to succeed as part of an export-led recovery. The <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SFO">SFO</a>, being helpful, says, Yes, if people come to us, were prepared to give them advice and not prosecute them. If people are trying to self-cleanse, we will give them a nice, positive attitude to try to help businesses in good quality new managements.</p> <p>The Under-Secretary, however, is not prepared to give guidance that a small business can rely on, or to allow people to ring up or go and see someone to whom they can explain their circumstances and have a deal done. As a Justice <a href="/glossary/?gl=35" title="Ministers make up the Government and almost all are members of the House of..." class="glossary">Minister</a>, she wants to stand up strongly for the right of the prosecutor never to be fettered and to be able to look at every scrap of evidence when he is deciding whether to prosecute.

                                  <div class="debate-speech__content">                <p> When the legislation is in place, it will be down to prosecutorial discretion here as well. I note the hon. Gentlemans acknowledgment that the new <a href="/glossary/?gl=98" title="A parliamentary bill is divided into sections called clauses.    Printed in..." class="glossary">clause</a> is worthy of further work, and I take that on board.</p> <p>My hon. Friend the Member for Rugby and Kenilworth made a good and important point about new clause 3 when he said that the cost of the advisory service could be recouped from the savings made from non-prosecutions and from the process not being followed up at a later time.</p> <p>My hon. Friend the Member for Poole talked about how the service would be useful for companies that did not understand what they might be letting themselves in for. He also made the interesting point that it could be used as a weather vane for corruption activity around the world and that that could be fed back to the administrator.</p> <p>My hon. Friend the Member for North-East Hertfordshire spoke about the benefits of self-cleansing that would be made available. He also forcefully made the point that the interests of the country, the judicial system and business needed to be balanced. He made his case very well that the Under-Secretarys interpretation might be rather rigid.</p> <p>The Under-Secretary made some cursory remarks about the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SFO">SFO</a> guidance. She did not analyse the guidance, which I think is making a move towards providing informalI might have incorrectly used the word unofficial earlieradvice. That is moving the debate forward, but she did not recognise that. She then said that, to the extent that the guidance is helpful, it was limited to specific circumstances. I have read out the specific circumstances, which were cases of bribery, so the guidance is very specific, and specific to what we are discussing. The Under-Secretary, however, is almost ignoring the implications of that.</p> <p>The Under-Secretarys differentiation between the US system and ours was also unconvincing. She spoke about how a service could muddy the waters, but it cuts both waysin many cases, the waters can be pretty muddied anyway. We are not talking about the black and white situations that I felt she dipped into at various points. The waters will often be muddy. The proposal could, in certain situations, provide a mechanism that would allow companies to get some clarity, particularly those that cannot afford the expensive legal advice required at an early stage before securing a contract. To that extent, it would be particularly helpful for SMEs working in developing areas, which we hope will happen more often if our economy is to pick up.</p>            </div>
