As the Foreign Secretary made clear in the most recent six-monthly report on Hong Kong,  this has been and continues to be the most concerning period in Hong Kong&#8217;s post-handover history. The apparent focus of the Hong Kong authorities now seems to be on retribution against political opposition and the silencing of dissent. In the light of our concerns, we have taken decisive action in relation to the erosions of rights, freedoms and autonomy in Hong Kong, specifically in response to the national security law. This has included a new immigration path for British nationals (overseas), suspending our extradition treaty with Hong Kong and extending our arms embargo on mainland China to Hong Kong.</p><p pid="b1124.7/2">We have made clear our concerns about a number of ongoing cases, and that includes the sentencing of the pro-democracy activists Joshua Wong, Agnes Chow and Ivan Lam on <phrase class="date" code="2020-12-02">2 December</phrase> and the charges laid against the major media proprietor Jimmy Lai on the same day. We understand that the three sentenced on <phrase class="date" code="2020-12-02">2 December</phrase> pleaded guilty to inciting people to take part in an unauthorised rally last year. They were not charged under the national security law. As the Foreign Secretary made clear in his statement of <phrase class="date" code="2020-12-02">2 December</phrase>, prosecution decisions must be fair and impartial, and the rights and freedoms guaranteed to the people of Hong Kong under the joint declaration must be upheld. Hong Kong&#8217;s prosperity and way of life rely on respect for fundamental freedoms, an independent judiciary and the rule of law.</p><p pid="b1124.7/3">British judges have played an important role in supporting the independence of Hong Kong&#8217;s judiciary for many years. That independence is a critical factor underpinning Hong Kong&#8217;s success. We want it to, and hope that it will, continue; however, the national security law that was imposed on Hong Kong in July poses real questions for the rule of law in Hong Kong, and the protection of fundamental rights and freedoms promised by China in the joint declaration. It is therefore right that the UK Supreme Court continues to assess the situation in Hong Kong, and the position of British judges, in discussion with the Government.</p><p pid="b1124.7/4">We have raised our concerns about these and other cases with senior members of the Hong Kong Government and the Beijing authorities, and we will continue to do so. We urge the Hong Kong and Beijing authorities to bring an end to their apparent campaign to stifle legitimate opposition, and to reconsider their current course. The Government will continue to work with international partners to hold China to account, as we did recently at the UN Third Committee on <phrase class="date" code="2020-10-06">6 October</phrase>, where 39 countries expressed deep concern at the situation in Hong Kong, Xinjiang and Tibet. The UK Government will continue to stand up for the people of Hong Kong and our historic responsibility.&#8221;</p>            </div>

They will be considered when the scheme becomes operational. As the noble Baroness knows, that will be from <phrase class="date" code="2020-01-31">31 January</phrase> 2021.

As I have said before from the <a href="/glossary/?gl=171" title="If you've ever seen inside the Commons, you'll notice a large table in the..." class="glossary">Dispatch Box</a>, the UK wants a mature, positive relationship with China.

Its size, rising economic power and influence also make it an important partner in tackling some of the biggest global challenges. As we have already seen on Covid-19, there is an immense scope for co-operation. As we look forward to 2021, the recent announcements that have been made by the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chinese_Government">Chinese Government</a> provide enormous scope for positive, constructive engagement and wide-ranging opportunities, from trade to co-operation on tackling climate change.

Equally, we will not accept investment that compromises our national security. And, as we have repeatedly said, in international fora such as the UN Third Committee or the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_Rights_Council">Human Rights Council</a>, where we have direct concerns&#8212;whether on Xinjiang in China, or Hong Kong, as we are discussing today&#8212;we will raise them. We will raise them bilaterally, in multilateral fora and in partnership with key countries and other member states, because it is important that we speak up against the suppression of human rights, wherever it occurs.</p>            </div>
