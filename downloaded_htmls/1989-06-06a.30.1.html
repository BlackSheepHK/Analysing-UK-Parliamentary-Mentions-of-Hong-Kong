During the last few days, units of the Chinese army have been engaged in the violent suppression of peaceful and popular demonstrations in the streets of Peking. The indiscriminate and unprovoked use of military force has caused the death or injury of thousands of students and other innocent civilians.</p> <p>
I am sure that all <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Members_of_the_House">Members of the House</a> will share the worldwide sense of horror and join in the international condemnation of the slaughter of innocent people.</p> <p>
I summoned the Chinese charge d'affaires yesterday. I told him that the British Government and people were united in condemning the merciless treatment of peaceful demonstrators, and deeply deplored the use of force to suppress the democratic aspirations of the Chinese people. 1 told him that the British Government looked to the Chinese authorities to fulfil their obligations to Hong Kong in the joint declaration of 1984. 1 reminded him of the responsibilities of the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chinese_Government">Chinese Government</a> to ensure the safety of British citizens and Hong Kong residents.</p> <p>
I expressed concern at the maltreatment of British journalists, particularly Michael Fathers of <i><a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Independent">The Independent</a></i> and Johnathan Mirsky of <i><a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Observer">The Observer</a>.</i> We have since seen disturbing reports of the ill-treatment of <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kate_Adie">Kate Adie</a> of the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BBC">BBC</a>.</p> <p>
Our ambassador in Peking and his staff have been working round the clock to ensure the safety of British citizens and Hong Kong residents in Peking and, as far as possible, in other parts of China. The embassy hay, advised against travel to any part of China. It has also advised those who are concerned about their safety and have no pressing need to remain in China to leave immediately.</p> <p>
Since the cultural revolution there has been a substantial improvement in relations between the United Kingdom and the People's Republic of China as the Chinese Government have sought to broaden their contacts with the international community and to introduce economic and other reforms. Friends of China in this House and around the world must share the hope that sane and balanced government will be swiftly and securely restored in Peking. In present circumstances, however, there can be no question of continuing normal business with the Chinese authorities.</p> <p>
Her Majesty's Government have therefore decided on the following action.</p> <p>
All scheduled ministerial exchanges between Britain and China have been suspended. The visit of the Chinese <a href="/glossary/?gl=35" title="Ministers make up the Government and almost all are members of the House of..." class="glossary">Minister</a> of Justice, who was due to arrive here tomorrow, has been cancelled. My right hon. Friend the Minister of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food has also cancelled his forthcoming visit to China.</p> <p>
The proposed visit of their Royal Highnesses the Prince and Princess of Wales to China in November clearly cannot take place so long as those responsible for the atrocities over the past weekend remain in control of the Chinese Government.</p> <p>
All high-level military contacts with China have been suspended.</p> <p>
All arms sales to China have been banned.</p> <p>
At the same time, the Government are examining how we can respond to any requests for humanitarian assistance from non-governmental organisations.</p> <p>
The whole House will share the Government's special concern about the implications for Hong Kong of what has been happening in Peking. The Government understand and share the grave concern felt by the people of Hong Kong. We have all been deeply impressed by the strength and restraint of their response to what has happened.</p> <p>
Everything that has been accomplished in Hong Kong has been achieved in the unique context of the geography and history of the territory and by the talent and enterprise of its people. All of that underlines the extent to which the future prosperity of Hong Kong must depend on a successful and secure partnership with the Government and people of China. That objective is enshrined in the commitments made by the British Government and the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Government_of_China">Government of China</a> under the joint declaration. Those commitments were reaffirmed by the charge d'affaires when he called on me yesterday.</p> <p>
But it is self-evident that if we are to have confidence in the commitment of the Chinese Government to their obligations, there must be a stable and responsible Government in Peking. <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_British_Government">The British Government</a> will stand by their obligations under the joint declaration. The Government and the House look to the Government of the People's Republic of China to live up to that international commitment as well.</p> <p>
The events in Peking must affect the prospects and procedure for implementation of the joint declaration. Consultations about the second draft of the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basic_Law">Basic Law</a> for Hong Kong have been suspended. It is also difficult to see how our own contacts with the Chinese Government about the future of Hong Kong can continue in present circumstances.</p> <p>
Meanwhile, I assure the House that we shall be conducting a thorough examination of the programme for advancing and consolidating effective democracy in Hong Kong. We are considering urgently what further steps can be taken to enshrine and protect Hong Kong's freedoms and way of life after 1997.</p> <p>
All of us in this House are acutely conscious of the wish of the people of Hong Kong to secure some form of assurance for themselves and their families. I know that this has been one of the issues studied by the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Select_Committee">Select Committee</a> on <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foreign_Affairs">Foreign Affairs</a>.</p> <p>
Some commentators have recommended that a right of abode in this country should be given to the 31/4 million people in Hong Kong who hold British nationality. We share the desire of the House to do everything we can to enhance the security of the people of Hong Kong. On that basis, the Government are looking urgently and sympathetically at the scope for flexibility. But the House will appreciate the reason why we could not easily contemplate a massive new immigration commitment which could&#8212;and the possibility cannot be disregarded &#8212;more than double the ethnic minority population of the United Kingdom.</p> <p>
Our overriding aim must be to do everything possible to secure the continuation of those conditions in Hong Kong that have led to its outstanding success over the last

century. I hope the House will send a message to the people of Hong Kong reaffirming our commitment to their secure, stable and prosperous future.</p> <p>
<a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Chinese">The Chinese</a> people are seeking from their Communist leadership rights and liberties which are taken for granted in the free world. The slaughter in Peking is a tragic setback to the campaign for democracy, but I hope this House will send a united message. China cannot ignore the lessons which are being learned elsewhere in the world. Economic prosperity and personal liberty go hand in hand. People will not for ever tolerate government by repression.</p>            </div>

                                  <div class="debate-speech__content">                <p>My hon. Friends and I condemn outright and in the strongest terms the abominable massacres which have been perpetrated in Beijing. Those of us who have great feelings of friendship for China and have watched its political and economic progress with hope and satisfaction are particularly appalled at this regression to barbarity. It is impossible for us to return to those attitudes so long as this bloodstained repression continues and until it is clear that those in control of China repudiate it.</p> <p>
The scenes of carnage on our television screens have horrified us all. I pay tribute to the courageous journalists who have reported the events, and in particular to the remarkable <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kate_Adie">Kate Adie</a> of the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BBC">BBC</a> who has risked her life to get the news to Britain.</p> <p>
We admire the swift and positive action taken by <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/President_Bush">President Bush</a> to demonstrate the anger of the United States.</p> <p>
We support the action which Her Majesty's Government have taken and which the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foreign_Secretary">Foreign Secretary</a> has just announced. I wish, though, that as well as suspending arms sales&#8212;and of course we support that suspension&#8212;he would examine the possibility of cancelling all other exports to China, including exports of vehicles which could be used for repression of the civilian population.</p> <p>
I also ask whether the Foreign Secretary will consult the other Governments of the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_Community">European Community</a> to ensure that firm and concerted action is taken by the whole Community. I should be grateful if he could tell the House what action the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Kingdom_Government">United Kingdom Government</a> are considering taking in the United Nations on this matter.</p> <p>
We have been told&#8212;and of course we welcome it&#8212;about the action which the Government are taking, so far as they can, to protect and assist British citizens at present in Beijing and any other areas that may be affected. Will our embassy also be accepting its responsibility for the safety of Hong Kong citizens&#8212;journalists, business people and others&#8212;who may be caught up in these disturbances?</p> <p>
It is essential for the Government to take whatever action is open to them to provide reassurance for the people of Hong Kong. In eight years their colony is due to be incorporated into China, but only if the safety, welfare and governance of Hong Kong remain the sole responsibility of this United Kingdom <a href="/glossary/?gl=192" title="The House of Commons is one of the houses of parliament. Here, elected MPs..." class="glossary">House of Commons</a>.</p> <p>
As the Foreign Secretary knows, the <a href="/glossary/?gl=29" title="The Opposition are the political parties in the House of Commons other than..." class="glossary">Opposition</a> recommended that elections to the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hong_Kong_Legislative_Council">Hong Kong Legislative Council</a> should take place last year. That was not done. We now ask the Foreign Secretary urgently to consider the possibility of bringing forward the elections scheduled for 1991 if possible to this year, but certainly to no later than


next year, and that a higher proportion of the Legislative Council be directly elected. This would be a signal to the people of Hong Kong of our concern for their assured democratic future and to the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Government_of_China">Government of China</a> that Britain is determined that the terms of the joint declaration be adhered to by them as well as by the United Kingdom.</p> <p>
I suggest to the Foreign Secretary that as soon as possible he should himself go to Hong Kong to discuss the possibility of advancing the election date, as well as to explain to the people and representatives of Hong Kong what he means in his statement today by talking about flexibility regarding the right of abode in this country. I also suggest that the right hon. and learned Gentleman should consider travelling as soon as practicable to Beijing to obtain from the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chinese_Government">Chinese Government</a> the firmest possible assurances that the joint declaration will be adhered to&#8212;<i>[Interruption.]</i> I would have thought that that would gain assent from the overwhelming <a href="/glossary/?gl=37" title="The term &quot;majority&quot; is used in two ways in Parliament. Firstly a Government..." class="glossary">majority</a> in the House.</p> <p>
These are times of turmoil and I do not for a moment suggest that the Government should pretend to be able to do more than they can do. At the same time, whatever can be done must be done, for the sake of the people of Hong Kong and to make it clear to the Government of China that, while China should be welcomed into the wider world community as a great and growing power, that welcome must be conditional upon the Government of China conducting themselves in accordance with the standards of civilisation that they have been trampling on in recent days.</p>            </div>

                                  <div class="debate-speech__content">                <p>I am grateful to the right hon. Gentleman for the generally supportive tone of everything that he has had to say because it is clear that on all these matters there is very widespread agreement in the House.</p> <p>
I begin by echoing his tribute to the journalists of the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BBC">BBC</a>, Independent Television and the newspapers, and indeed to those of other countries. One of the most remarkable features of what has been happening in the last few weeks has been the continued opportunity for the rest of the world to see what has been going on in Peking, and also for Peking to know what has been going on in the rest of China, as a result of the free transmissions of radio from the rest of the world. The openness which has been at least a part of what has taken place in China has played a crucial part in events thus far.</p> <p>
The second question which the right hon. Gentleman raised was about the possibility of extending a prohibition to other exports to China, with particular reference to vehicles. Obviously all such questions must remain under consideration. Our basic principle is to subscribe to the position as outlined by <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/President_Bush">President Bush</a>, that it is important to maintain diplomatic, commercial and other human contacts, so far as is safe and possible, with the people and <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Government_of_China">Government of China</a> in order to try and retain the opportunity for recreating their previous open disposition.</p> <p>
<a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_Community">European Community</a> co-operation is under urgent consideration among the 12 countries and the Political Committee is meeting today. Already, the meeting due to take place between the Commission and a Chinese ministerial mission yesterday has been cancelled.</p> <p>
The right hon. Gentleman will have seen that the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secretary-General_of_the_United_Nations">Secretary-General of the United Nations</a> has expressed his own personal and deep concern about what has happened and has called for the restoration of restraint and moderation in Beijing. However, it is also plain that there

is particular difficulty in pursuing in that organisation questions about human rights affecting one of the permanent members of the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Security_Council">Security Council</a>.</p> <p>
I made it plain in my statement that the British embassy has been putting great efforts into protecting and establishing contact with all British nationals and Hong Kong people in Beijing and elsewhere in China, without differentiation.</p> <p>
The right hon. Gentleman raised the matter of representative government in Hong Kong. It is important to recognise that the changes that we have sought to introduce so far in that respect have been those that command the widest possible support in the territory.</p>            </div>

It is also equally clear that in the light of recent events, opinion in Hong Kong has been evolving&#8212;<i>[Interruption.]</i> Wait for it. Even before the events of last weekend, the Executive and Legislative Councils called unanimously for full democracy by 2003&#8212;<i>[Interruption.]</i> That is what they called for. It is right that we should consider, in light of the recommendations of the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Select_Committee">Select Committee</a> on <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foreign_Affairs">Foreign Affairs</a> and debates in this House, how we should respond to those views.</p> <p>
I welcome the importance attached by the right hon. Gentleman to the joint declaration. That declaration embodies the substantial principles on which the future of Hong Kong should be built. The crucial point is to secure compliance with that declaration, translated into the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basic_Law">Basic Law</a>, as fully and effectively as possible by a responsible Government in Beijing.</p> <p>
I recognise that there is wisdom in trying to find an opportunity to establish contact with ministerial opposite numbers in Beijing as soon as it makes sense to do that. It is equally clear that it would not make sense to try to do so in the present circumstances. The suggestion of a visit to Hong Kong is sensible and I will discuss it with the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Governor_of_Hong_Kong">Governor of Hong Kong</a> in London later this week.</p>            </div>

If democracy were to triumph in what is clearly a developing power struggle, everything would be well, but I am sure that the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foreign_Secretary">Foreign Secretary</a> is right to begin to think ahead, in case the worst should happen. Is it not the case that, under the joint declaration, <a href="/glossary/?gl=100" title="http://www.army.mod.uk/" class="glossary">the army</a> that we have seen butchering its fellow citizens on the streets of Peking will be on the streets of Hong Kong in eight years' time? Is it surprising, therefore, that the last vestige of faith that many in Hong Kong had in the joint declaration, has been severely damaged and will have to be patiently rebuilt?</p> <p>
Let me welcome two aspects of the Foreign Secretary's statement. He said that negotiations taking place under the joint declaration will be suspended. Will he use the interim to try to build up international support for the joint declaration, perhaps through the medium of the United Nations? I welcome, too, the Foreign Secretary's flexible attitude to the application of the British Nationality Act. Does he realise that many will be watching closely to see how that develops?</p> <p>
I ask the Foreign Secretary to consider three further steps. First, will he set as the target that he has identified for the development of democracy in Hong Kong the establishment by 1991 of a Legislative Council at least half of whose members have been directly elected? [HON. MEMBERS: "Why half?"] At least half, as a first step, by 1991.</p> <p>
Secondly, when the excellent David Wilson's term as <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Governor_of_Hong_Kong">Governor of Hong Kong</a> is up, will the Foreign Secretary consider providing a Hong Kong belonger to take his place&#8212;perhaps one elected from the Legislative Council?</p> <p>
Thirdly, does the right hon. and learned Gentleman agree that all free western democracies have a real national interest in ensuring that democracy survives in Hong Kong? Does he agree that there may be a case for the Government considering a conference of the free western democracies to see whether an agreement could be reached whereby they could provide a last-resort sanctuary for the people of Hong Kong, as the ultimate bulwark for the survival of democracy?</p>            </div>

                                  <div class="debate-speech__content">                <p>I am impressed by the extent to which the right hon. Gentleman has learnt the case for patience. It is certainly right that we should await developments in Peking, because no one can yet foresee what will happen there, and much depends upon it.</p> <p>
The right hon. Gentleman is also right&#8212;I welcome his remarks&#8212;to underline the importance of the joint declaration and of securing the effective commitment of the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chinese_Government">Chinese Government</a> to that declaration.</p> <p>
The right hon. Gentleman drew attention in particular to the need to mobilise international support for the joint declaration. It was for that reason that the declaration was drawn up in the form of an international agreement and registered by both nations simultaneously at the United Nations. For that reason, incidentally, when I presided over the 40th anniversary meeting of the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Security_Council">Security Council</a> &#8212;with the Chinese Foreign <a href="/glossary/?gl=35" title="Ministers make up the Government and almost all are members of the House of..." class="glossary">Minister</a>&#8212;I drew attention to the importance of the agreement that had been arrived at between us. The then <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chinese_Foreign_Minister">Chinese Foreign Minister</a> endorsed the agreement in the presence of that body. The highest solemnity needs to be attached to that if the Chinese Government are to be reminded of the importance that we attach to the declaration.</p> <p>
The right hon. Gentleman made some suggestions. On the composition of the Legislative Council, I have already made it plain that options and opinions are evolving in Hong Kong as a result of recent events. As soon as a clear view emerges, we shall be considering the best and most effective way to give effect to that. That is one of the matters that I shall wish to discuss when I am able to visit Hong Kong.</p> <p>
It is much too early to consider the replacement of the present <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Governor_of_Hong_Kong">Governor of Hong Kong</a>, but the whole House will welcome the tribute that the right hon. Gentleman paid to the quality of <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sir_David_Wilson">Sir David Wilson</a>, who has been bearing a heavy burden in recent weeks.</p> <p>
The right hon. Gentleman referred to the prospect of an international conference on the refuge of last resort. I do not think that that is the right way of handling the matter. It is most important to concentrate not only on aspects of British nationality law but on the best way of restoring confidence in the prospects for Hong Kong.</p>            </div>

It is important to note that there are still many people inside China and representing her throughout the rest of the world who also share that sense of grief.

The hon.

inescapable facts of geography and history to which I referred in my statement. One such fact is the expiry of the lease in 1997. It is on that basis that we have secured the support of the House for the achievements of the joint declaration, to which the House attaches importance. My hon. Friend is also right to warn against xenophobia in any aspect of managing a problem of such complexity. I think that he would go too far if he were to believe that the capacity of people outside China to influence the future there should be described as infinitesimal. Of course, the prospect of having influence upon a mass population of 1&#183;25 billion and on the people who seek to govern that country is in one sense very small. Yet, if one thinks of the huge impact of the opinion of the rest of the world as a result of the openness that has come about in recent years, if one thinks of the incredible reality that the leader of the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soviet_Union">Soviet Union</a> was there only a few weeks ago, being hailed as a champion of democracy, and if one thinks of the changes that have been able to have an impact on that society, my hon. Friend should not despair too much of the ability of the rest of us to make some impact on prospects for the people of China.</p>            </div>

to their feelings. During the early and difficult months of negotiation I went to the territory to try to explain to the people and to their representatives how the matter was proceeding. Perhaps no one recognises more than I do the importance of continuing to strengthen that bond of trust between the people and those who represent them, however indirectly, in this Parliament.</p>            </div>

Members, have recently returned from China and Hong Kong. We were in Beijing during the beginnings of the student demonstrations about three weeks ago. I find it, therefore, heartrending to see on television the very same streets that I walked upon now covered with dead bodies, blood and wrecked vehicles.</p> <p>
The discussions that we had with the students in the square at that time clearly indicated that all that the students wanted to do was to talk to the Government. The end result of the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chinese_Government">Chinese Government</a> not talking to the students or their representatives has been confrontation, chaos, conflict and death. Is not the lesson to be learnt that, when a Government refuse to talk to their people, the end result will be what we have seen on television during the past few days?</p> <p>
In the very brief time we spent in Hong Kong, we discovered that what the people of Hong Kong&#8212;I emphasise the people of Hong Kong&#8212;clearly desire from the British Government is a very early change over to representative government in Hong Kong. If it were possible for the Government to take that wish into account and to bring the elections forward, that would restore some of the confidence in the people of Hong Kong, which has been greatly shattered in the past few days.</p>            </div>

We fortunately have that kind of relationship through the hon. Gentleman, and through many other hon. Members, with the people of Hong Kong, and we are able to hear and take account of their views. The tragedy of what has happened in Peking is that such an attitude of discussion and non-confrontation appeared to prevail through the early weeks of the extraordinary events there. The horror of the tragedy is that it has only been in the past few days that such profound unwisdom has seized of the minds of those who govern China.</p>            </div>

As we all know, to demonstrate under a dictatorship takes tremendous courage. Is it not a fact that foreign correspondents were constantly asked if the countries from which they came supported what the demonstrators were trying to do? On reflection, perhaps the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foreign_Secretary">Foreign Secretary</a> will agree that the democracies&#8212;not only that of our country but other democracies&#8212;could have spoken out before the bloodshed started over the weekend.</p> <p>
Are there not some people in the Chinese leadership &#8212;perhaps, the person who was general secretary of the Communist party until a few days ago, and his predecessor, whose death started the demonstrations, and in the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chinese_Communist">Chinese Communist</a> party at senior levels&#8212;who recognise that, just as in eastern Europe and <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soviet_Union">Soviet Union</a> change had to come, so it has to come in China? Stalinism is dead, and all the bullets and all the terror in the world cannot keep Stalinism going.</p>            </div>

implicit in the fact that 92 per cent. of the territory reverts to China in 1997. Any viable future for Hong Kong must be based on co-operation and co-existence with China, not on confrontation. Any attempt to design some alternative to that, dependent upon the goodwill of almost any organisation that the hon. Gentleman cares to name, would be of little, if any, value in the absence of the right relationship with China. That is why I have no doubt about the wisdom of arriving at the joint declaration. I have no doubt about the importance of underlining its significance for the future. Our first task is to restore the substance and confidence that can be placed in it.</p>            </div>
