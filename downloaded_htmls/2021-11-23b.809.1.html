The latter make up a large proportion of the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/British_Armed_Forces">British Armed Forces</a> today. I come back to the very narrow point I made in Committee: it is an anomaly that among those withdrawn from Afghanistan in <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operation_Pitting">Operation Pitting</a> in August were former members of the Afghan national army, who have now been given right of residence in this country and are in a better position than foreign and Commonwealth soldiers, and Gurkha soldiers who have served shoulder to shoulder with us for at least four years, and in many cases for much longer.</p> <p pid="b804.0/3">This is bizarre and it is an anomaly.

As the noble and gallant Lord, <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lord_Craig">Lord Craig</a> of Radley, said earlier, this issue, particularly in relation to Hong Kong, has been raised time and again, not year after year but decade after decade. The time to solve this one is now. I very much hope that the noble Baroness and the Government will move quickly on this issue. It is high time to do so.</p>            </div>

We need the Government to do more than give lip service to this.</p> <p pid="b805.0/2">As the noble and gallant Lord, <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lord_Craig">Lord Craig</a> of Radley, pointed out just now, until citizenship is resolved for those from Hong Kong who have served with our forces, the very least we can do is look at ways to ensure that indefinite leave to remain does not cost people a king&#8217;s or a queen&#8217;s ransom. The cost of securing indefinite leave to remain is unconscionable. If somebody has a right to indefinite leave to remain, surely it is appropriate that the cost of securing it is the cost of administering it. If those of us who are British apply for a passport, we pay an amount of money that seems a lot to many individuals but is essentially an administrative cost. The cost of securing indefinite leave to remain is far more than that administrative cost.</p> <p pid="b805.0/3">I am aware that decisions on this are down not to the <a href="/glossary/?gl=23" title="Secretary of State was originally the title given to the two officials who..." class="glossary">Secretary of State</a> for Defence but to the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Home_Office">Home Office</a>. Therefore, rather than asking the <a href="/glossary/?gl=35" title="Ministers make up the Government and almost all are members of the House of..." class="glossary">Minister</a> to commit at this stage to reducing the cost of applications for indefinite leave to remain, all we can ask her to do is to go back and raise this question again with the Home Office.</p> <p pid="b805.0/4">I also ask the Minister whether we cannot help her. Is there some way in which Parliament can say to the Home Office, &#8220;This is something you must do&#8221;? It goes beyond questions of how many individuals are coming to live in the United Kingdom or targets of tens of thousands of people. It is about the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UK">UK</a>&#8217;s duty to those who have served with us. Is there some way in which Parliament can make that case to the Home Office? Can we, as Members of your Lordships&#8217; House and the <a href="/glossary/?gl=129" title="The House of Lords. When used in the House of Lords, this phrase refers to..." class="glossary">other place</a>, help the Ministry of Defence do the right thing and put some pressure on the Home Office to reduce the costs?</p> <p pid="b805.0/5">It is not appropriate to ask for &#163;2,000 or more from somebody who served with us, or from their family. If somebody who has a spouse and children wants and needs indefinite leave to remain, surely they do not want that on their own; they want to come with their families. The noble Lord, Lord Dannatt, pointed out at this stage and in Committee that people who have come from Afghanistan under ARAP have come with their dependants. If we think that there is a right for citizens from the Commonwealth and Hong Kong and the Gurkhas who have served with us&#8212;and for us&#8212;to come and live in this country, surely we should give them the opportunity to do so without making the cost prohibitive.</p> <p pid="b805.0/6">If the Minister cannot give us a guarantee on reducing the costs&#8212;I suspect she cannot&#8212;can she at least give us some guidance on how we might be able to help her to persuade the Home Office to do the right thing?</p>            </div>

Since then I have met many who have returned from Afghanistan at official events. It is extraordinary when you hand out the medals and you come to somebody who is quite obviously of Commonwealth origin, and you actually have discrimination standing there in front of you. You have wounded people, if not physically then mentally, who are on parade. You are standing there and giving them a medal, and under your breath you are saying, &#8220;This is horrifying. I am totally horrified that you do not have the same or similar rights as the man or lady next door.&#8221;</p> <p pid="b806.0/2">This&#8212;our regard and respect for those people&#8212;surely comes under the spirit of the covenant. We simply cannot let this lie. It is not a great number of people, compared with the number receiving money put out as a result of Covid or, dare I say it, the number crossing the Channel. This could be killed here and now, in one go, and all those people would be not only happy but that much prouder to be as British as we would like them to be for their service abroad.

There was a degree of unanimity around the House that this issue needed to be addressed. The <a href="/glossary/?gl=35" title="Ministers make up the Government and almost all are members of the House of..." class="glossary">Minister</a> was good enough to say that, although she would not reply on <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amendment_4">Amendment 4</a> to the issue of Hong Kong ex-servicemen, when we reached this part of our proceedings on <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amendment_26">Amendment 26</a> she would be able to give us some reply. I rather hoped that might mean she wanted some space to try to digest some of the points that he and I tried to make earlier.</p> <p pid="b806.1/2">I particularly reinforce what the noble Baroness, Lady Smith of Newnham, said about the relationship between the MoD and the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Home_Office">Home Office</a> on this. If nothing else comes of this evening, will the Minister agree to facilitate a meeting involving perhaps those who have participated in this debate but also her noble friend <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lady_Williams">Lady Williams</a> of Trafford, at which we might try to make some progress on these two questions&#8212;one about citizenship and the other about the specific position of the Hong Kong ex-servicemen?</p> <p pid="b806.1/3">If the Minister has the figures, I wonder if she could share with the House the number of people we are talking about who fall into the category&#8212;whether the figures I gave earlier are correct or not. Sometimes it is what you do in small things that matters most, and we are talking about very small numbers of people. It was a point alluded to my noble friend <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lord_Brookeborough">Lord Brookeborough</a> a few moments ago, that when you compare this very small group with the number of people who try to arrive in the United Kingdom&#8212;some illegally&#8212;it is how we behave towards them that will matter.</p> <p pid="b806.1/4">This brought me back briefly to debates in <a href="/glossary/?gl=112" title="During a debate members of the House of Commons traditionally refer to the..." class="glossary">another place</a> in 1983, when I spoke on the nationality Act about citizenship and the effects it would have on people in Hong Kong. Sadly, many of the things predicted during that debate have come to pass. The trajectory  we all hoped that Hong Kong might be on post 1997 &#8212;&#8220;one country, two systems&#8221;, and an honouring of the difference between Hong Kong and mainland China &#8212;has clearly not happened. That has left people in a precarious position, and none more so than those who served the Crown. I reinforce the point I made earlier: these people&#8217;s lives are clearly now in danger, and we have a duty to do something about that. It is a point that my noble friend <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lord_Dannatt">Lord Dannatt</a> made as well.</p> <p pid="b806.1/5">That is all I wanted to say. I know I had the chance to speak earlier on. I hope the Minister will think about how she can, in a practical way, take these two relatively small questions forward and see if we can get some justice for those involved.</p>            </div>

I am also grateful to those who have contributed to the debate, not least the noble and gallant Lord, <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lord_Craig">Lord Craig</a> of Radley, the noble Baroness, Lady Smith, the noble Viscount, <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lord_Brookeborough">Lord Brookeborough</a>, and the noble Lords, <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lord_Dannatt">Lord Dannatt</a> and <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lord_Alton">Lord Alton</a>.</p> <p pid="b807.0/2">I think your Lordships will understand that I am at the <a href="/glossary/?gl=171" title="If you've ever seen inside the Commons, you'll notice a large table in the..." class="glossary">Dispatch Box</a> as MoD <a href="/glossary/?gl=35" title="Ministers make up the Government and almost all are members of the House of..." class="glossary">Minister</a>. I cannot speak on behalf of the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FCDO">FCDO</a> or the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Home_Office">Home Office</a>, but let me try and address some of the more technical issues to at least give context to what the amendment seeks to achieve. The first thing I want to say is that the Government highly value the service of all members of our Armed Forces, including: our Commonwealth nationals, our Gurkhas in Nepal, who have a long and distinguished history of service to the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UK">UK</a> both here and overseas; and former <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/British_Hong_Kong">British Hong Kong</a> service personnel.</p> <p pid="b807.0/3">Before I address the detail of the proposed new clauses, I would like to say a few words about the process for setting immigration fees. Application fees for immigration and nationality applications have been charged for a number of years. They are charged under powers set out under Section 68 of the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immigration_Act_2014">Immigration Act 2014</a>. They play a vital role in our country&#8217;s ability to run a sustainable borders and immigration system, reducing the burden that falls on taxpayers.</p> <p pid="b807.0/4">Sitting beneath the Immigration Act are a fees order and fees regulations, all of which are scrutinised by both Houses before they come into effect; there is a democratic prism to all this. This system ensures checks and balances, and it seeks to maintain the coherence of the immigration fees framework as set out in legislation. If we were to remove these fees during the passage of this Bill, as the noble Lord, Lord Coaker, suggests in his amendment, it would undermine the existing legal framework for fees, without proper consideration for either the sustainability of the system or fairness to the UK taxpayer. It would also reduce clarity in the fees structure by creating an alternative mechanism for controlling fees which sits outside the immigration fees regime.</p> <p pid="b807.0/5">When non-UK service personnel, including Commonwealth citizens and Gurkhas from Nepal, enlist in the regular Armed Forces, they are granted exemption from immigration control status for the duration of their service. That is to allow them to  come and go without restriction. They are free from any requirements to make visa applications or pay any fees while they serve, and that is unlike almost every other category of migrant coming to work in the UK. Those who have served at least four years or been medically discharged as a result of service can choose to settle in the UK after their service and pay the relevant fee.</p> <p pid="b807.0/6">As a number of your Lordships are aware, the time before discharge that such settlement applications can be submitted has been extended this year from 10 to 18 weeks. Those applying for themselves do not have to meet an income requirement, be sponsored by an employer, or meet any requirements regarding their skills, knowledge of the English language or knowledge of life in the UK, again putting them in a favourable position compared with others who seek to settle here. We recognise, however, that settlement fees may place a financial burden on non-UK serving personnel wishing to remain in the UK after their discharge, and we recognise the strength of feeling of parliamentarians, service charities and the public on this issue.</p> <p pid="b807.0/7">Your Lordships will be aware that the Ministry of Defence, together with the Home Office, ran a public consultation between <phrase class="date" code="2021-05-26">26 May</phrase> and <phrase class="date" code="2021-07-07">7 July</phrase> 2021 regarding a policy proposal to waive settlement fees for non-UK service personnel in <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HM_Armed_Forces">HM Armed Forces</a>. The results of the consultation have been used to advise Ministers and, once collective agreement has been secured for a final policy, the Government will publish their response, make any associated changes to fees through fees regulations, which are updated at least twice a year, and appropriately address tax implications through the relevant secondary legislation.</p> <p pid="b807.0/8">For those non-UK veterans of the Armed Forces who do not have settled status in the UK, we are also exploring what options there are to assist them. Under the British nationality selection scheme, a limited number of personnel who were settled in Hong Kong could apply to register as British citizens. All veterans would have been eligible to acquire British National (Overseas) status between 1986 and 1997, and therefore many should hold that status already. Those who hold that status may be eligible for the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BN">BN</a>(O) visa that was launched in January of this year. This provides a route to settlement in the UK, meaning that many former British-Hong Kong service personnel, their spouses and dependants will already have, or be on the path to having, settlement and subsequently British citizenship. The fees they pay are therefore connected to their BN(O) status and not their former service.</p> <p pid="b807.0/9">I am aware that the Minister for Safe and Legal Migration, Kevin Foster <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MP">MP</a>, met with a delegation of <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hong_Kong_Military_Service_Corps">Hong Kong Military Service Corps</a> personnel in May this year and listened to their representations. The Home Office is continuing to consider the representations made on behalf of those personnel who were unable to obtain citizenship through the selection scheme, but there are currently no plans to reopen applications for BN(O) status or expand the eligibility for the BN(O) route. As the noble Baroness, Lady Smith, helpfully observed, this is a Home Office responsibility and not an MoD one.</p>            </div>

Therefore, while I cannot give the answers that noble Lords are no doubt impatient to receive&#8212;I sympathise with their impatience but think they will understand that I am in an impossible position in terms of providing the answers&#8212;I certainly undertake to use my offices as a <a href="/glossary/?gl=35" title="Ministers make up the Government and almost all are members of the House of..." class="glossary">Minister</a> in MoD to see whether I can do anything to facilitate the provision of information. In these circumstances, I hope the noble Lord will withdraw his amendment.</p>            </div>

It is time the Government got a grip on this. The sense that this is simply a detail in a wider issue simply does not understand the concept. These people have demonstrated a loyalty that most of us have never had to. We are honoured to have a couple of people here who have demonstrated that loyalty: to be willing, on the whim of a politician, to go out and fight for us&#8212;not for their country but for Britain. You cannot ask for more loyalty than that; it is a test that I am not sure I would have passed. But these people came along and served. The history of Commonwealth soldiers, sailors and airmen fighting for this country is a long one, and they deserve to be considered quite separately from these wider issues.</p> <p pid="b810.0/3">I am not going to divide the House&#8212;frankly, there is not enough of the House around to be worth dividing&#8212;but I hope the <a href="/glossary/?gl=35" title="Ministers make up the Government and almost all are members of the House of..." class="glossary">Minister</a> will take away the enormous strength of feeling on this issue. What really came out to me from this is that it is crucial that the Government, at the most senior level, understand that this is not an immigration issue; it is about people who have been willing to demonstrate ultimate loyalty to our Government and who would make the perfect citizens of this country. I hope the slightly warm sense that we got from some of the Minister&#8217;s words will bear fruit very soon. With that, I beg leave to withdraw the <a href="/glossary/?gl=114" title="As a bill passes through Parliament, MPs and peers may suggest amendments -..." class="glossary">amendment</a>.</p> <p class="italic" pid="b810.0/4"><a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amendment_26">Amendment 26</a> withdrawn.</p> <p class="italic" pid="b810.0/5"><a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amendment_27">Amendment 27</a> not moved.</p>            </div>
