The story alleged that two individuals, including a parliamentary researcher, had been arrested on charges of conducting espionage on behalf of China.</p> <p pid="c665.1/2">These are serious allegations, and it is right that they are being thoroughly investigated by the police and relevant agencies. We must not hamper their work or prejudice any future legal processes by what we say today&#8212;as I believe, <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mr_Speaker">Mr Speaker</a>, you said at the beginning of today&#8217;s proceedings. As you would expect me to say, it would therefore be inappropriate for me to comment on any specific aspect of the active investigation itself. I would, however, point the House to what the Metropolitan police said in their own statement:</p> <p class="indent" pid="c665.1/3" pwmotiontext="yes">&#8220;The investigation is being carried out by officers from the Met&#8217;s <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Counter_Terrorism_Command">Counter Terrorism Command</a>, which has responsibility for investigations relating to allegations of <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Official_Secrets_Act">Official Secrets Act</a> and espionage-related offences&#8221;.</p> <p pid="c665.1/4">Of course, any decision on whether to proceed with a prosecution under the Official Secrets Act, and related legislation, would be a matter for the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crown_Prosecution_Service">Crown Prosecution Service</a>.</p> <p pid="c665.1/5">It remains an absolute priority for the Government to take all necessary steps to protect the United Kingdom from any foreign state activity which seeks to undermine our national security, prosperity and democratic values. The Government have been clear that China represents a systemic challenge to the United Kingdom and to our values. That has been evidenced in China&#8217;s continued disregard for universal human rights and international commitments in Xinjiang, its erasure of dissenting voices and stifling of <a href="/glossary/?gl=29" title="The Opposition are the political parties in the House of Commons other than..." class="glossary">opposition</a> under its new national security law in Hong Kong, and disturbing reports of Chinese coercion and intimidation in the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_China">South China</a> sea. We are clear-eyed about that challenge, and we must be able to look the Chinese in the eye and call out unacceptable behaviour directly, just as our <a href="/glossary/?gl=264" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prime_Minister_of_the_United_Ki ngdom" class="glossary">Prime Minister</a> was able to do this with <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Premier_Li">Premier Li</a> at the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/G20">G20</a> summit in New Delhi this weekend&#8212;an approach that has also been taken consistently by our <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Five_Eyes">Five Eyes</a> allies.</p> <p pid="c665.1/6">Actions speak louder than words, and that is why I took the decision to instruct Departments to cease deployment of all surveillance equipment subject to China&#8217;s national intelligence law from sensitive Government sites in November last year. It is one of the reasons why I banned TikTok from Government devices; the Government investigated and called out the so-called Chinese overseas police service stations and, as the <a href="/glossary/?gl=35" title="Ministers make up the Government and almost all are members of the House of..." class="glossary">Minister</a> for Security, my right hon.

When used in the House of Lords, this phrase refers to..." class="glossary">other place</a>. The Bill will include national security debarment provisions that will enable us to act when we  see malign influence in our public procurement. In taking this approach, we are aligned with our Five Eyes allies and other <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/G7">G7</a> partners&#8212;indeed, every single G7 partner.</p> <p pid="c665.1/8"><a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_UK">The UK</a> will deploy, again, an aircraft carrier to the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indo-Pacific">Indo-Pacific</a> in 2025; we have announced <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AUKUS">AUKUS</a>, a new security partnership that will promote a free and open Indo-Pacific that is secure and stable; and we will work with Italy and Japan through the global combat air programme to adapt and respond to the security threats of the future, through an unprecedented international aerospace coalition.</p> <p pid="c665.1/9">These <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Houses_of_Parliament">Houses of Parliament</a> stand as a monument to the freedoms of expression and belief that underpin our values, but just as these institutions have provided the paradigm for so many modern democracies, there are still those who fear such freedoms, and who seek to undermine them and to interfere in our society. We maintain constant vigilance in our efforts to understand and root out that interference, and we will always take action to address it, whatever its source.</p> <p pid="c665.1/10">In 2022, the Government established the defending democracy taskforce, a group that works to co-ordinate across Government to protect the integrity of our democracy from threats of foreign interference. It is engaging across Government, with Parliament, the UK&#8217;s intelligence community, the devolved Administrations, local authorities, the private sector and civil society on the full range of threats facing our democratic institutions. Those threats include foreign interference in the electoral process, disinformation, physical and cyber threats to democratic institutions and those who represent them, foreign interference in public offices, political parties and our universities, and transnational repression in the United Kingdom.</p> <p pid="c665.1/11">Earlier this year, the Government passed the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Security_Act_2023">National Security Act 2023</a>, which has overhauled legislation applicable to espionage, sabotage, and any persons acting for foreign powers against the safety and interest of the United Kingdom. The measures in the Act will enable our law enforcement and intelligence agencies to deter, detect, and disrupt the full range of modern-day threats, including threats from China. New offences in the Act will enable the disruption of illegitimate influence conducted for, or on behalf of, foreign states, whether designed to advance their interests or to harm the United Kingdom. The <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Kingdom_Government">United Kingdom Government</a> will do whatever it takes to protect our national security and this nation's democratic institutions, which have stood for centuries as a beacon of liberty&#8212;wherever the threat may come from.</p> <p pid="c665.1/12">I commend this statement to the House.</p>            </div>

I pay tribute to all those in our intelligence and security services and police, and those across  Government and beyond, who work to protect our national security on the anniversary of the awful attacks of 9/11. As we remember those lost, we are in no doubt about the seriousness of the work that they do.</p> <p pid="c666.1/3">We recognise, too, the seriousness of the allegations involving espionage on behalf of China at the heart of our democracy. It is essential that the police, the intelligence agencies and the justice system are able to do their jobs, and we must support them as they do so. However, we need to know more about what action the Government are taking against attempts by other states to interfere in our democracy and undermine our security. <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MI5">MI5</a> issued an interference alert about the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chinese_Communist">Chinese Communist</a> party attempting to influence Parliament 20 months ago. <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Security_Service">The Security Service</a> and others have also raised wider concerns. The <a href="/glossary/?gl=35" title="Ministers make up the Government and almost all are members of the House of..." class="glossary">Minister</a> referred to the <a href="/glossary/?gl=264" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prime_Minister_of_the_United_Ki ngdom" class="glossary">Prime Minister</a> raising strong concerns with China about unacceptable interference. Did the Prime Minister do so at the time of those arrests, or has he only done so now, since they have been made public?</p> <p pid="c666.1/4">The Government set up the defending democracy taskforce to look at foreign interference, but what has it actually done? Is the Minister on it? Has it produced a report for the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Security_Council">National Security Council</a> as was promised? Has it looked at vetting levels and delays? The Government opposed the Lords <a href="/glossary/?gl=114" title="As a bill passes through Parliament, MPs and peers may suggest amendments -..." class="glossary">amendment</a> to the National Security Bill that was put forward to introduce stronger checks on donations to political parties, to ensure no foreign influence, and they opposed Labour&#8217;s proposal to close the loophole on shell companies. Has the taskforce looked at those measures? Why is it not acting in that area?</p> <p pid="c666.1/5">What is being done about national security prisoners? It beggars belief that <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Daniel_Khalife">Daniel Khalife</a> was charged with national security offences but was able to escape under a van. Can the Minister confirm that even though this individual had already evaded arrest for three weeks when the police first tried to apprehend him, he still ended up in a category B prison? Can he also confirm reports that in 2019 another prisoner was able to escape from Wandsworth prison, also by hiding underneath a van? Has the review been completed of all national security prisoners&#8212;those on remand and those convicted &#8212;to see what level of prison security is in place? If not, why not?</p> <p pid="c666.1/6">I want to ask the Minister about the wider issue of the risks to our national security from other states. He has rightly taken action on sensitive surveillance equipment and I am glad that Ministers have accepted Labour&#8217;s proposals on procurement. In his statement, he rightly talked of the systemic challenge that China poses, including on human rights, but the statement says nothing about the work of the investment security unit. What is it doing? Nor does the statement say anything about the comprehensive approach we need to the risks to our critical national infrastructure, even though the head of MI5 has given a series of warnings and the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intelligence_and_Security_Committee">Intelligence and Security Committee</a> was extremely critical in its report in July, warning of the lack of a proper strategy on China and of short-termism. We need to engage with China on climate change and global issues, but we also need to be robust about defending our national security. That is why the <a href="/glossary/?gl=137" title="The shadow cabinet is the name given to the group of senior members from..." class="glossary">shadow</a> <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foreign_Secretary">Foreign Secretary</a> has called for a full audit of China&#8217;s relationship and why  we have supported the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Security_Act_2023">National Security Act 2023</a> but also raised concerns about Iran pursuing kidnap and murder threats and Russia pursuing cyber-attacks.</p> <p pid="c666.1/7">We recognise that after 9/11 and the appalling terror attacks on 7/7, the country came together. The then <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Labour_Government">Labour Government</a> worked on a major counter-terror strategy&#8212;the Contest strategy&#8212;involving everyone across Government, the police, the intelligence agencies, local government and the private sector. <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Contest">The Contest</a> strategy has endured and has strong cross-party support, but the Government have been warned for years about rising state challenges, so where is the Contest strategy for state threats? We will support the Government in producing one, and a Labour Government would work cross-party to produce one, but where is it? We need a Contest strategy on state risks, state challenges and state threats to protect our national security. National security is too important to ignore warnings; we need urgent action to defend our national security.</p>            </div>

                                  <div class="debate-speech__content">                <p pid="c668.0/1">I thank the <a href="/glossary/?gl=137" title="The shadow cabinet is the name given to the group of senior members from..." class="glossary">shadow</a> <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Home_Secretary">Home Secretary</a> for the overall constructive approach with which she has addressed this issue. It is important that we treat issues such as this on a cross-party basis in defence of our democratic institutions, and it is timely that this statement should be made on the anniversary of 9/11. I will endeavour to address the points that she has raised, and I will be happy to write to her on any points that I inadvertently miss out.</p> <p pid="c668.0/2">The <a href="/glossary/?gl=264" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prime_Minister_of_the_United_Ki ngdom" class="glossary">Prime Minister</a> and the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foreign_Secretary">Foreign Secretary</a> regularly raise with their Chinese opposite numbers Chinese interference in democratic institutions. This is an ongoing approach that has been going on for some time.</p> <p pid="c668.0/3">The right hon. Lady asked about the defending democracy taskforce, which is led by my right hon. Friend the <a href="/glossary/?gl=35" title="Ministers make up the Government and almost all are members of the House of..." class="glossary">Minister</a> for Security. It reports into the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Security_Council">National Security Council</a>, on which I sit, and we receive regular updates on the work that he is doing, working with Departments across Government, not least the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Department_for_Levelling_Up,_Housing_and_Communities">Department for Levelling Up, Housing and Communities</a>, which is responsible for large elements of electoral integrity, the devolved Administrations, local authorities and other matters. The purpose of the taskforce is to bring together all those different elements to pursue a whole-of-Government and whole-of-society approach when addressing those threats.</p> <p pid="c668.0/4">The principal purpose of the investment security unit is to provide advice to me, as the quasi-judicial decision maker, in respect of acquisitions that may invoke national security questions. I take advice from the unit on whether the Government should intervene, and we have issued 15 directions in respect of acquisitions in the past year. That is to say we are asking companies to take action, the hardest being to block the acquisition, but it could be some other remedial action. More than half of those directions are in respect of Chinese companies.</p> <p pid="c668.0/5">The right hon. Lady is entirely right to raise the question of critical national infrastructure, on which I have worked very closely with the head of <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MI5">MI5</a> and others. Countries around the world are looking again at their critical national infrastructure, particularly in relation to the threat of cyber-crime, which often has a blurred link with hostile states. I take cyber-crime very seriously, and I chair regular meetings on it. We are constantly upping the work we do, against a background in which the external threat continues to rise.</p> <p pid="c668.0/6">The Government will very shortly respond to the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISC">ISC</a>&#8217;s report. The draft is with Ministers, and it is about to be signed off. I hope it will be with the House this week.</p> <p pid="c668.0/7">The right hon. Lady rightly raises points about Iran and Russia, particularly in relation to cyber but also across a whole range of issues. As part of our overall approach, we have done two things. First, we have tried to give the agencies a public face with which to interface with businesses and private citizens in a whole-of-society approach. For example, <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GCHQ">GCHQ</a> now works through the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Cyber_Security_Centre">National Cyber Security Centre</a> to advise businesses and individuals on cyber-risks. Equally, we have just created the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Protective_Security_Authority">National Protective Security Authority</a>, which essentially enables MI5 to interface with businesses and individuals on protective security. Those agencies, working through the <a href="/glossary/?gl=108" title="The cabinet is the group of twenty or so (and no more than 22) senior..." class="glossary">Cabinet</a> Office and particularly with the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Home_Office">Home Office</a> and the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foreign_Office">Foreign Office</a>, work across the range of issues that particularly arise in relation to Iran and Russia.</p> <p pid="c668.0/8">Although we take this investigation very seriously, and it clearly should be conducted independently, I reassure the right hon. Lady and the House that the Government are taking a whole-of-society approach across all these issues to strengthen our defences against rising threats.</p>            </div>

She is absolutely right to say that China represents a systemic challenge to our interests and values, and it is also, for example, the No. 1 state-based threat to our economic security. The Government are absolutely clear-eyed about the threats that this nation faces and we are robust in taking action. Indeed, that is why I personally took the decisions in respect of banning Huawei from our 5G networks, and in respect of Chinese <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CCTV">CCTV</a> technology and TikTok. We will continue to take whatever steps are necessary, based on appropriate advice, to provide that protection for our nation and our democratic institutions.</p>            </div>

As the Chair of the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intelligence_and_Security_Committee">Intelligence and Security Committee</a> said, No. 10&#8217;s response to our China report was to pooh-pooh it and say that it was out of date. I understand  that the Government response was due today but has now been put off. The defending democracy taskforce has been mentioned. We have asked for an update on that but are met with radio silence. The <a href="/glossary/?gl=264" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prime_Minister_of_the_United_Ki ngdom" class="glossary">Prime Minister</a> has on his desk our report on international partnerships. He has had it on his desk for nearly 10 months now. He usually has 10 days in which to respond, so when will we get that signed off? May I just say to the <a href="/glossary/?gl=91" title="The office of Deputy Prime Minister is one that has only existed..." class="glossary">Deputy Prime Minister</a> that if he is talking about security and democracy in the terms he has, that has to include proper scrutiny?

I have been delighted to work with two successive Chairs of the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foreign_Affairs_Committee">Foreign Affairs Committee</a>, to whom I pay enormous tribute for the outspoken way in which they have pushed the Government towards a more sensible policy on China.</p> <p pid="c674.5/2">My anxiety is that we still flip-flop all over the place. This year already we have seen several <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foreign_Secretaries">Foreign Secretaries</a>, apart from anything else, and we have seen them wanting to suck up to China one moment and the next wanting to have robust words with China. It simply does not work. Why oh why have we still not declared that China is a threat to UK national security? Why oh why have we still not seen even the redacted version of the China strategy which, according to the Government, the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FCDO">FCDO</a> developed but which has not even been shared with other Government ministries?</p>            </div>

First, we must protect our national interests in relation to China. That is why we passed the legislation that I have outlined, why I banned Huawei from our 5G networks and why we banned Chinese technology from surveillance equipment and other matters.</p> <p pid="c675.0/2">Secondly, it is important that we align with our allies around the world. I spend a lot of time on this and know that the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foreign_Secretary">Foreign Secretary</a>, the <a href="/glossary/?gl=35" title="Ministers make up the Government and almost all are members of the House of..." class="glossary">Minister</a> for Security and others work very closely with nations around the world, particularly but not confined to the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Five_Eyes">Five Eyes</a>, to make sure that we share our understanding of Chinese intent and take co-ordinated action to protect us, not least through the military</p> <p pid="c675.0/3">It is also the case, though, that we must engage with the Chinese, as we do with many other countries around the world with which we do not share a number of their values. It is not a realistic position to take to say that we should entirely cut off from engagement with China. We should engage with China but be absolutely clear about where we disagree with it and clear-eyed in protecting our national security, which is precisely the approach we are taking.</p>            </div>

I want to raise a couple of issues with the <a href="/glossary/?gl=91" title="The office of Deputy Prime Minister is one that has only existed..." class="glossary">Deputy Prime Minister</a>. The Government are moving, they have done lots of new things and we are getting more coherence, but I do not understand why they keep thinking that we either bury our heads in the sand or effectively go soft on elements of the relationship with China. We can debate with and engage with China all we like, but we can also do so in an increasingly robust way that answers the threat it presents towards us.</p> <p pid="c675.1/2">Specifically, the Government keep avoiding the argument about the growing economic dependency that all western nations have on China. That dependency will mean that in the case of war in the Pacific in two or five years&#8217; time, which is what <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/President_Xi">President Xi</a> is planning for&#8212;he has said, &#8220;We are retaking Taiwan by 2027.&#8221;&#8212;we will not be in a position to do anything about it without collapsing the global economy. Effectively, in the next few years, our hands will have been tied by economic dependency. Every time I raise that issue, the Government are not even willing to produce an annual statement on it. Please can we take this issue more seriously? It is at the heart of security, and no freedom of action means we have no security.</p>            </div>

I have outlined a number of the measures that we take; we continue to keep all those things under review. I want to reassure him and other Members on both sides of the House that we are absolutely clear about the threat that China represents, but at the same time, it is right that we engage with China, and that is the approach that we are taking, alongside working closely with our allies. I think that is a sensible and balanced approach that in no way underestimates the scale of the challenge in respect of China, as has been set out in numerous documents.</p>            </div>

Through the creation of the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Cyber_Security_Centre">National Cyber Security Centre</a> and its work with <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GCHQ">GCHQ</a>, we are able to constantly increase our action in respect of cyber-threats, malware and the other threats that my hon.
