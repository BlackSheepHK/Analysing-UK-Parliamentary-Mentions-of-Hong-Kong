                                  <div class="debate-speech__content">                <p pid="b1502.2/1">My Lords, the draft legislation passed last week by the People&#8217;s <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Congress_of_China">Congress of China</a> threatens to be the death knell for &#8220;one country, two systems&#8221;, the framework agreed before Britain handed Hong Kong over to China in 1997 that protected its special status. The legislation would undermine Hong Kong&#8217;s high degree of autonomy and be a serious threat to human rights there. I therefore welcome the Statement made by the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foreign_Secretary">Foreign Secretary</a> in the <a href="/glossary/?gl=192" title="The House of Commons is one of the houses of parliament. Here, elected MPs..." class="glossary">House of Commons</a> on Tuesday that if China does not reconsider its approach, the UK will not just look the other way when it comes to the people of Hong Kong; we will stand by them and live up to our responsibilities.</p> <p pid="b1502.2/2">I shall outline the following issues: the nature of the legislative process so far, what it means for Hong Kong and why the UK should take action to protect the freedoms of the people there. My main questions to the <a href="/glossary/?gl=35" title="Ministers make up the Government and almost all are members of the House of..." class="glossary">Minister</a> today are as follows. What is the Government&#8217;s current assessment of the legislation&#8217;s impact on human rights in Hong Kong if it were to be enacted? What will they do next to fulfil the commitment made by the Foreign Secretary in the House of Commons and by the <a href="/glossary/?gl=264" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prime_Minister_of_the_United_Ki ngdom" class="glossary">Prime Minister</a>, writing in <a href="/glossary/?gl=49" title="http://www.timesonline.co.uk/" class="glossary">the Times</a> newspaper yesterday? What factors will the Government then take into account when deciding on their next steps?</p> <p pid="b1502.2/3">Last week the People&#8217;s Congress rubber-stamped a draft decision. That resolution will now pass to China&#8217;s senior leadership to be fleshed out into a draft law. The proposals outlaw behaviour deemed to be subversion, terrorism, separatism, assisting foreign interference or endangering national security. Charges such as these are often used in mainland China to detain dissidents and political opponents. It now seems that the era of Hong Kong&#8217;s political freedom could be over and that many could become criminals for actions that were legal until now.</p> <p pid="b1502.2/4">Reportedly, Beijing wants the law to be implemented before Hong Kong&#8217;s own legislative elections in September. Direct imposition of the security law by Beijing, rather than through Hong Kong&#8217;s own institutions, would curtail the liberties of those in Hong Kong and dramatically erode Hong Kong&#8217;s autonomy and the system that made it so prosperous. Through the Sino-British joint declaration, we aimed to protect the city&#8217;s unique status and defend some of its key institutions, such as the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Legislative_Council">Legislative Council</a> and the court. The rule of law and an independent judiciary are the foundations on which Hong Kong&#8217;s success is built. Both are at risk from the draft legislation.</p> <p pid="b1502.2/5">The legally binding joint declaration, signed by China and the UK, and registered at the UN, sets out that Hong Kong will have a high degree of autonomy. It also provides that rights and freedoms, including those of the person, of the press, of assembly, of association and others, will be enshrined in law in Hong Kong, and that the provisions of the two UN covenants on human rights&#8212;the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Covenant_on_Civil_and_Political_Rights">International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights</a> and the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights&#8212;shall remain in force. But, as the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hong_Kong_Bar_Association">Hong Kong Bar Association</a> has pointed out, there is no assurance in the draft decision that the law will comply or be required to comply with those provisions.</p> <p pid="b1502.2/6">If &#8220;global Britain&#8221; is to mean anything, it is vital that we maintain our values and uphold the agreements we signed up to. We have a duty to the people of Hong Kong to do just that. I have the honour to chair your Lordships&#8217; <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Select_Committee">Select Committee</a> on <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Relations">International Relations</a> and Defence. It was a privilege to take over the chair last year from my noble friend <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lord_Howell">Lord Howell</a>, who is speaking in this debate. He led us on our major inquiry into UK foreign policy in a shifting world order. The report concluded that the Government should work with China</p> <p class="indent" pid="b1502.2/7">&#8220;in a manner which is consistent with the rules-based international order&#8221;.</p> <p pid="b1502.2/8">It also noted:</p> <p pid="b1502.2/9">&#8220;In the longer term, the Government will need to weigh up the strategic challenge posed by China&#8217;s approach to its international role, and its impact on the rules-based international order, against China&#8217;s growing economic significance.&#8221;</p> <p pid="b1502.2/10">In their response to our report, the Government stated that</p> <p class="indent" pid="b1502.2/11">&#8220;China&#8217;s position is sometimes at odds with parts of the rules based international system. Where China&#8217;s approach challenges important principles of the order, such as human rights&#8212;an important part of the international architecture&#8212;we and our allies speak up for our values.&#8221;</p> <p pid="b1502.2/12">Given that, what will the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UK_Government">UK Government</a> do next? Ministers have already made it clear that they will commit themselves that if the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chinese_Government">Chinese Government</a> go through with their proposed legislation, the UK will do the following. First, they will work with the international community on these matters. The joint statement by the UK, US, Australia and Canada last week was welcome, but how will they now develop that international partnership beyond the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Five_Eyes">Five Eyes</a>? Secondly, they will put in place new arrangements to allow British nationals overseas to come to the UK  without the current six-month limit, which would include a path to citizenship. Does that include their dependants?</p> <p pid="b1502.2/13">What impact, if any, will economic decisions have on the course of action the Government decide to take in fulfilling their commitments? Will they feel constrained by the vast flows of capital and trade between Britain and China? I would hope not and I believe that as we navigate the way ahead, we should continue to be an outward-looking country that is a champion of collective security, the rules-based international system and free trade, and a defender of human rights. Those are the values that have served us well and we should be constant in upholding them. I look forward to the Minister&#8217;s response.</p>            </div>

The new national security law will fatally damage the &#8220;one country, two systems&#8221; agreement on Hong Kong. China is already breaking international law by its actions in the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_China_Sea">South China Sea</a>; its threats to Taiwan are becoming more vociferous; it is stealing <a href="/glossary/?gl=261" title="patents (for inventions), trade marks, protected designs, and copyrights;..." class="glossary">intellectual property</a> on an industrial scale and taking other aggressive actions in cyberspace; it is increasingly using its economic clout to browbeat and threaten smaller nations; and its treatment of minorities and trade in human organs is unacceptable among civilised nations.</p> <p pid="b1504.2/2">I ask the <a href="/glossary/?gl=35" title="Ministers make up the Government and almost all are members of the House of..." class="glossary">Minister</a>: is it not time to take some deterrent action, rather than appeasement, to show China that the international community will not put up with this? Appeasement, as we found with Hitler, will encourage bad behaviour and could finally lead to war. We should, for example, encourage the main westernised trading nations to recognise Taiwan; set up a new south-east Asia treaty organisation on the sort of scale we did with <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NATO">NATO</a> in 1949; revitalise like-minded nations to review the successful world order established post <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_War_II">World War II</a> and make it fit for purpose in this new world; work with our allies to review all trading links with China; and review Chinese investments and educational links.

Many in Hong Kong fear that their protests on <phrase class="date" code="2020-06-04">4 June</phrase>, to recognise the sacrifice  made by other young people, may well be the very last. My question is about young people, which the noble Baroness, Lady Anelay, alluded to. The Government&#8217;s plan suggests that the right to visit visa-free for those with <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BNO">BNO</a> status will be extended from six months to 12 months, but there are 250,000 people with BNO passports out of an estimated 2.9 million people with BNO status. They had to secure that before <phrase class="date" code="2020-06-30">30 June</phrase> 1997, and it cannot be passed down to children. There are nearly 7.5 million people in Hong Kong. Given that the greatest threat is to the young people of Hong Kong&#8212;many born after 1997&#8212;or to the children of those with BNO status, how will we show affinity with those young people and offer them the kind of support that we will offer others?</p>            </div>

There is nothing unusual about security legislation; after all, Britain made use of emergency legislation during its stewardship of Hong Kong. What matters is how such legislation is implemented in practice. Hong Kong&#8217;s <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Justice_Secretary">Justice Secretary</a> asserts that her department&#8212;not its Chinese counterpart &#8212;will make all prosecution decisions under the national security law and that Hong Kong&#8217;s judicial procedures will be followed, and I trust that she is right. Hong Kong&#8217;s Government accept that the security law is needed, and so does a substantial part of the Hong Kong business community. Both believe that Hong Kong&#8217;s future economic prospects will be better safeguarded and investment more readily attracted with a security law that is applied in line with Hong Kong&#8217;s common law traditions.</p> <p pid="b1505.0/2">The <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foreign_Secretary">Foreign Secretary</a> has spoken up well for Hong Kong&#8217;s rights, making it clear that support from Britain does not extend to violent rioting or to claims for independence that have no basis in history or law. The <a href="/glossary/?gl=264" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prime_Minister_of_the_United_Ki ngdom" class="glossary">Prime Minister</a>&#8217;s proposal to extend the rights of <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BNO">BNO</a> passport holders, if the new security law is misapplied, will reassure <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hong_Kongers">Hong Kongers</a> that they have a safety net if one is needed. The most satisfactory outcome will be a national security law by which Hong Kong citizens feel protected rather than threatened. China&#8217;s present leaders should show the same wisdom and leadership as China&#8217;s then leader, <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deng_Xiaoping">Deng Xiaoping</a>, when he agreed the 1984 joint declaration and the principles it contained.</p>            </div>

I am pleased to see that he will be speaking in this debate. This sense of personal freedom dies hard. A real fear of its loss is causing many protestors to take extraordinary risks.

I am distressed that today the annual candlelight vigil to celebrate or remember that disaster has been cancelled in Hong Kong, and I hope it is soon replaced. My heart is therefore with the protesters, young and old, but unfortunately they eschewed a strong leadership and have had no exit strategy. My head asks: why has <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LegCo">LegCo</a> not passed its own security <a href="/glossary/?gl=38" title="Laws are the rules by which a country is governed. Britain has a long..." class="glossary">laws</a>? It operates under the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public_Order_Ordinance">Public Order Ordinance</a> of 1967, which was a British ordinance, and has not dealt with it. LegCo is dysfunctional, reduced this week to throwing stink bombs and having struggles on the Floor. It would be far better employed in holding a full consultation with the Hong Kong people and promulgating its own law.</p>            </div>

I agree with much that has been said, but I shall make  one distinctive contribution about how we should go about this, which is that we could take a lead in building a coalition of islands, including Japan and Taiwan as well as Hong Kong, and including the West Indies, Sri Lanka and <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Zealand">New Zealand</a>. We have three mutual interests here: combating rising sea levels; ensuring the freedom of the seas; and resisting mainland domination. Islands are distinctive things and such an approach would bind Hong Kong closer to us.</p>            </div>

The COP in 2021 in Glasgow is another opportunity to show China that it is a key player in the future of our planet.

As regards the visa extension scheme, I understand that the trigger for the extension is the text of the law being published. Will the Government bring forward the detail of the scheme before it is triggered so that action can be taken immediately? As my noble friend <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lady_Jay_of_Paddington">Lady Jay of Paddington</a> asked, can the Minister clarify whether the scheme is for current <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BNO">BNO</a> passport holders? If so, is or was there a cut-off date for applications, or is it envisaged that the scheme will be extended to all those eligible to apply?</p> <p pid="b1512.0/2">This scheme does not solve the problems for many people in Hong Kong or the long term, so what other actions are being considered? Can the Minister set out why the Government seem to be resisting an international contact group or a UN special envoy for Hong Kong? These seem to be sensible suggestions that have widespread support.</p> <p pid="b1512.0/3">Finally, I join the noble Lord, Lord Rennard, in his call for Magnitsky-type legislation for the UK.

It will not be easy to engage <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/President_Xi">President Xi</a> on the issue of Hong Kong. It is very sensitive. In the past, contact groups seemed to have some success; I have been involved with both of them. The first was in <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Africa">South Africa</a> in 1978. Eventually, Namibia moved to independence as a result of that contact group&#8217;s work, although it took 12 years. The other was in the Balkans in 1994 and undoubtedly helped to lay the foundations for the success of the Dayton accords and all that had gone before in the negotiations. Assembling many countries to work together is difficult. The key aspect of a contact group is that it does so at all levels: politicians, diplomats, lawyers and sometimes even the military. That is one of the most practical ways of proceeding.</p>            </div>

Of course, I am strongly against Chinese bullying and strongly in favour of a united front among nations in addressing China over Hong Kong&#8217;s future as an autonomous region. We have been through some of this before&#8212;for instance, when I chaired the old <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LegCo">LegCo</a> inquiry on British national (overseas) passports in Hong Kong back in 1996&#8212;but, as with so many issues nowadays, the middle ground here has evaporated. It seems that you have to be on the side of the protesters, however violent and disruptive some of their actions are, or you are deemed to be a lackey of Beijing.</p> <p pid="b1513.2/2">There is a middle path. It is totally in China&#8217;s interests to see Hong Kong flourish as part of the vast <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greater_Bay_Area">Greater Bay Area</a> and totally in our interests, and those of our friends, to see Hong Kong prosper in stability and security. This is the basis on which tough and insistent dialogue with China must take place. Neither arbitrary China law nor the senseless street violence of Hong Kong rioters nor encouraging a mass exodus is the right way forward for this great and brilliant Chinese and world city.</p>            </div>

We are now facing what I think of as a Rhineland moment. It is a time when you have to draw the line, because the line has clearly been crossed. We have seen a lot of Chinese pressure over the years: China&#8217;s pressure on states not to recognise Taiwan; its pressure on countries when they entertained the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dalai_Lama">Dalai Lama</a>, as <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Cameron">David Cameron</a> did; and, more recently, its pressure on Australia when it called for an independent <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WHO">WHO</a> inquiry. It is time now for there to be some international action against bullying, and taking in 3 million citizens is not necessarily part of it. I call on the <a href="/glossary/?gl=35" title="Ministers make up the Government and almost all are members of the House of..." class="glossary">Minister</a> to tell us how he is going to get together with like-minded states and co-operate in opposing these Chinese moves.</p>            </div>

It would be helpful if the <a href="/glossary/?gl=35" title="Ministers make up the Government and almost all are members of the House of..." class="glossary">Minister</a> could arrange to put in the <a href="/glossary/?gl=271" title="See &quot;placed in the library&quot;." class="glossary">Library of the House</a> of Lords the telegram that the late Sir Alan Donald sent on <phrase class="date" code="2020-06-05">5 June</phrase> 1989, which was declassified a couple of years ago. It is a reminder of why so many people in Hong Kong today are concerned about what has happened.</p> <p pid="b1515.0/2">Secondly, people have referred to the national security law. There is, of course, a national security law in Hong Kong now. The worry is that the Chinese communists do not have in mind a national security law that respects the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Covenant_on_Civil_and_Political_Rights">International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights</a>. If they did, we would have seen a national security law some time ago.

Nothing is more fundamental to human rights in Hong Kong and elsewhere than an independent, impartial judiciary. Hong Kong has that; mainland China has not. An important feature of the judicial system in Hong Kong is that, since handover, its local <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Court_of_Final_Appeal">Court of Final Appeal</a> has replaced appeals to the <a href="/glossary/?gl=9" title="The Privy Council goes back to the earliest days of the Monarchy, when it..." class="glossary">Privy Council</a>. This was authorised by the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hong_Kong_Basic_Law">Hong Kong Basic Law</a> in London. The judges in the Court of Final Appeal are mostly from Hong Kong, but very senior judges or retired judges are from the United Kingdom, Australia or Canada and do participate. A clear violation of human rights in Hong Kong would be interference by China in the composition of the Court of Final Appeal for cases or categories of case, or interference in the filling of vacancies. There is no doubt that the independence of the Hong Kong judiciary is under attack, and this is a grave danger for the rule of law in Hong Kong.

Thirdly, we now need a coalition of the like-minded to come up with a common China strategy. Even in the days of the Cold War, there were agreed rules of the road to avoid miscalculations and nuclear war. That is wholly missing from our relationship with today&#8217;s increasingly aggressive China. Does the <a href="/glossary/?gl=35" title="Ministers make up the Government and almost all are members of the House of..." class="glossary">Minister</a> agree that the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/G7">G7</a> meeting will be an opportunity to forge such a coalition, and that the UK must play a leading part?</p>            </div>

The <a href="/glossary/?gl=264" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prime_Minister_of_the_United_Ki ngdom" class="glossary">Prime Minister</a> subsequently indicated that it would also include the 2.5 million eligible to apply for the passport.

Earlier this week, the Foreign Secretary said that he raised with the Hong Kong authorities last August the need for an independent inquiry. He then indicated that one response to the failure of the Hong Kong authorities to act would be to consider the new Magnitsky-type sanctions. When will we see the promised legislation from the sanctions Act approved by Parliament?</p>            </div>

                                  <div class="debate-speech__content">                <p pid="b1516.4/1">My Lords, I first join all noble Lords in thanking my noble friend Lady Anelay for tabling this debate and thank them  for their very focused contributions from the outset. There were a lot of questions; if I am unable to cover them in the time I have, following the usual courtesies I shall write to noble Lords and lay responses to those questions in Library.</p> <p pid="b1516.4/2">I am sure noble Lords will forgive me&#8212;and join me&#8212;if I start by paying tribute to the important contribution of my noble friend Lord Patten. He is for ever a reminder to us of the importance of standing up for the rule of law in the context of Hong Kong, and the role he played was instrumental. I listened carefully to all of his contribution, in particular his specific proposal to have the telegram of <phrase class="date" code="2020-06-05">5 June</phrase> 1989 <a href="/glossary/?gl=252" title="This phrase is often used in written answers to indicate that a minister..." class="glossary">placed in the Library</a>. I will certainly take that forward, and hope that we will be able to deliver on that in the very short term.</p> <p pid="b1516.4/3">As we all know&#8212;noble Lords alluded to this&#8212;on <phrase class="date" code="2020-05-28">28 May</phrase> China&#8217;s National People&#8217;s Congress adopted a decision that would impose a national security law on Hong Kong. Let me assure all noble Lords who have contributed that we share their concerns about this unprecedented development; my closing remarks will echo the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foreign_Secretary">Foreign Secretary</a>&#8217;s comment. I also thank those noble Lords, including my noble friends, who gave their support for the Government&#8217;s statement last week. I particularly note the support of the noble Baroness, Lady Northover, and the noble Lord, Lord Collins. More details will of course follow on the specifics of the announcements around BNOs. I will come on to that.</p> <p pid="b1516.4/4">As my noble friend Lord Patten and other noble Lords reminded us, Hong Kong&#8217;s success was built on its high degree of autonomy and freedoms. My noble friend <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lord_Howell">Lord Howell</a> made this point well. This is under the &#8220;one country, two systems&#8221; framework that China itself has long advocated and reaffirmed. This framework is enshrined in Hong Kong&#8217;s Basic Law and underpinned by the provisions of the Sino-British joint declaration of 1984. As my noble friend Lady Anelay reminded us, the joint declaration is a legally binding international treaty, a point also well made by the noble and learned Lord, Lord Hope. The treaty is registered with the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Nations">United Nations</a> and remains as valid today as it was when it was signed, more than 35 years ago.</p> <p pid="b1516.4/5">The imposition of a national security law on Hong Kong would lie in direct conflict with China&#8217;s international obligations. Yes, as my noble friend Lord Patten reminded us, there are provisions for a national security law. However, as several noble Lords including him pointed out, this imposition goes directly against those obligations under the Sino-British joint declaration. It would also lie in direct conflict with article 23 of Hong Kong&#8217;s Basic Law, which gives Hong Kong sole jurisdiction to enact these <a href="/glossary/?gl=38" title="Laws are the rules by which a country is governed. Britain has a long..." class="glossary">laws</a>. Imposing the national security law would undermine Hong Kong&#8217;s high degree of autonomy and threaten the freedom of its people. The Basic Law is unequivocal: it allows for Hong Kong to make its own laws and there are a limited number of areas in which Beijing can directly impose legislation. These include foreign and defence policy, and emergency legislation in extreme circumstances such as a state of war. As my <a href="/glossary/?gl=172" title="When speaking in the House of Commons, an MP will refer to another MP of..." class="glossary">right honourable friend</a> the Foreign Secretary has made clear, we do not oppose Hong Kong having a national security law. What we strongly oppose is its imposition by Beijing.</p> <p pid="b1516.4/6">The impact on human rights was touched on, rightly, by many noble Lords, including my noble friend Lord Bridgeman. The noble Lords, Lord Dubs and <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lord_Truscott">Lord Truscott</a>, reminded us about the joint declaration as well. The proposed national security law further raises the prospect of prosecution in Hong Kong for political crimes. It threatens to undermine existing commitments to protect the rights and freedoms of the people of Hong Kong, as set out in the joint declaration, which reflects the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Covenant_on_Civil_and_Political_Rights">International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights</a> and the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights. We are also acutely conscious that Hong Kong&#8217;s rule of law and world-class independent judiciary, as mentioned by several noble Lords including the noble and learned Lord, Lord Hope, are a cornerstone of its economic success and way of life. We will of course watch the impact of these proposed measures closely.</p> <p pid="b1516.4/7">I turn to <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Her_Majesty">Her Majesty</a>&#8217;s Government&#8217;s response. I have listened carefully to a number of helpful suggestions and detailed questions. If I may, I will respond in writing to several of them. However, we are very clear-eyed in our approach when it comes to China. That is rooted in our values and interests. The point was made about China and its partnerships. Several noble Lords, including my noble friend <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lord_Randall">Lord Randall</a>, reminded us of our international workings. When it comes to issues such as climate change&#8212;my noble friend reminded us of <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/COP_26">COP 26</a>&#8212;we believe that China also has a vital role in the international community, including in its global response to the pandemic. It has worked with many countries and the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Health_Organization">World Health Organization</a> in its response.</p> <p pid="b1516.4/8">It has always been the case that when we have concerns, we will raise them. On human rights, let me assure noble Lords that we will continue to raise the issue of the Uighurs, which was mentioned by the right reverend Prelate, as we have previously done at the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_Rights_Council">Human Rights Council</a> in Geneva. We will speak out.</p> <p pid="b1516.4/9">Several noble Lords, including the noble Lord, Lord Hannay, who speaks with great experience, referred to the proposal of the seven <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foreign_Secretaries">Foreign Secretaries</a>, including the noble Lord, <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lord_Owen">Lord Owen</a>, for a contact group. The noble Lord, Lord Alton, mentioned human rights and the importance of broad coalitions. My noble friends Lord Patten, Lord Balfe and Lady Helic talked about international action, as did the noble Baroness, Lady Northover. <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Last_Thursday">Last Thursday</a>, alongside his counterparts in Australia, Canada and the US, my <a href="/glossary/?gl=214" title="Right Honourable is a form of address used within the House of Commons, for..." class="glossary">right honourable</a> friend the Foreign Secretary released a joint statement expressing deep concern over the proposed new security legislation. We are working with <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Zealand">New Zealand</a>, Japan and, yes, our partners in the EU&#8212;which the noble Baroness, Lady Northover, and my noble friend Lady Helic mentioned&#8212;who also made statements expressing concern.</p> <p pid="b1516.4/10">The noble Baroness, Lady Jay, talked about the international group. My noble friend <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lord_Cormack">Lord Cormack</a> talked about broadening coalitions, including at the UN. I am sure that noble Lords will have seen that we raised the issue of Hong Kong at a recent <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Security_Council">Security Council</a> meeting, despite the challenges that China posed. We have taken steps towards creating broader coalitions. My noble friend Lady Meyer talked of  the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/G7">G7</a>, my noble friend <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lord_Bowness">Lord Bowness</a> talked of wider coalitions and the noble Lord, Lord Glasman, suggested how we might strengthen and broaden coalitions. I will of course reflect on all noble Lords&#8217; contributions regarding how we can further strengthen international opinion on this issue. I assure noble Lords that we will work with all international partners, including those in the EU, because we want to implore China to reconsider its current path.</p> <p pid="b1516.4/11">My noble friend <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lord_Wei">Lord Wei</a> talked of great hope, and we hope that hope can be restored. We encourage China to work with the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region Government and the people of Hong Kong. Several noble Lords rightly pointed out that the needs of the people should be put first in order to find a solution that will encourage dialogue and respect for human rights; I am unequivocal about that. I am proud to have among my responsibilities the role of <a href="/glossary/?gl=35" title="Ministers make up the Government and almost all are members of the House of..." class="glossary">Minister</a> for human rights for Her Majesty&#8217;s Government. It is important that we put human rights at the forefront of our agenda because by doing so, we will help to restore trust.</p> <p pid="b1516.4/12">The proposed imposition of a national security law&#8212;an incredibly sensitive subject in Hong Kong&#8212;would exacerbate existing divisions. From the beginning of the unrest, this Government have been committed to our responsibilities to the people of Hong Kong, to supporting their right to peaceful protest and to encouraging dialogue on all sides within the &#8220;one country, two systems&#8221; framework, to which several noble Lords pointed. The noble and learned Lord, Lord Hope, and my noble friend <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lady_Goudie">Lady Goudie</a> mentioned the independence of the judiciary; I agree with them. The noble and learned Lord, Lord Hope, also made a point about <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HBSC">HBSC</a> and companies that made statements about the national security law. I shall not comment specifically on that, but I underline our hope that China will think again in respect of enacting this law.</p> <p pid="b1516.4/13">In the time I have left, I will turn to the important issue of British nationals overseas. My noble friend Lady Anelay and the noble Baronesses, Lady Jay and <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lady_Falkner">Lady Falkner</a>, amongst others, talked passionately about this issue. The noble Baroness, Lady Falkner, asked about Taiwan. We have not changed our position on Taiwan. I reiterate that it is important that a lasting solution to any issues and disputes between both sides is brought to the fore by exchanges by both sides of the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taiwan_Strait">Taiwan Strait</a>.</p> <p pid="b1516.4/14">My noble friend Lady Hooper also mentioned the issue of students returning from Hong Kong. We are of course monitoring the situation. They have a right to return to the United Kingdom and we will do what we can to ensure that we facilitate their return.</p> <p pid="b1516.4/15">I am sure that noble Lords noted that the Foreign Secretary said last week and again on Tuesday that if China continues down this path, we will look to amend the arrangements for BNOs. The noble Lord, Lord Collins, raised that issue, as did other noble Lords. Under the current status, <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BNO">BNO</a> passport holders in Hong Kong are already entitled to UK consular assistance outside of China and protection and entry clearance for six months into the UK. However, in response to actions that the noble Lords, <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lord_Powell">Lord Powell</a> and <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lord_West">Lord West</a>, suggested, if China follows through with proposed legislation, the Government will put in place arrangements  to allow those with BNO status to live, work and study in the UK for an extendable period of 12 months. That will provide a path to citizenship, as my noble friend <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lord_Trimble">Lord Trimble</a> reminded us. We will keep the door open. The noble Baroness, Lady Kennedy, also mentioned that point.</p> <p pid="b1516.4/16">We want to give the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chinese_Government">Chinese Government</a> the chance to step back from their current course of action, and I note some of the questions that have been raised, including those from the noble Lord, Lord Purvis. I shall of course write to noble Lords regarding the questions I have not had time to answer.</p> <p pid="b1516.4/17">The noble Lord, Lord Collins, and the noble Baroness, Lady Kennedy, mentioned the Magnitsky proposals and secondary legislation in that respect. We are working through this and I assure noble Lords that it is certainly our aim to bring this to Parliament at an early stage&#8212;I hope in advance of the Summer Recess, but a lot of work is being done. I am sure that noble Lords will accept that it would not be appropriate for me to comment on specific designations at this point. The noble Lords, Lord Wood and <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lord_Campbell">Lord Campbell</a>, asked about Huawei. Our decision on that carries the strongest possible scrutiny.</p> <p pid="b1516.4/18">I thank my noble friend Lady Anelay for tabling this debate. I am sure this is an issue that we will continue to return to in the coming days and weeks, but I want to put on record that the UK and its partners have been clear to China. Imposing this national security legislation would be a clear violation of China&#8217;s international obligations, including those made to the United Kingdom under the joint declaration. I put on record our call to China to reconsider this path, because I assure all noble Lords that the UK will not look the other way when it comes to the people of Hong Kong.</p> <p class="italic" pid="b1516.4/19">Virtual Proceedings suspended.</p>            </div>
