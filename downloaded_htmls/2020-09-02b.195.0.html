                                  <div class="debate-speech__content">                <p pid="b187.2/1">I thank the hon. Lady for her question.</p> <p pid="b187.2/2">The creation of the new <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foreign,_Commonwealth_and_Development_Office">Foreign, Commonwealth and Development Office</a> today is a key moment: a key moment for our vision of a truly global Britain, and a key moment for our integration of our international efforts in order to maximise their impact abroad. With this innovation, we are drawing on the example of many of our allies, such as Australia and Canada and, indeed, the vast <a href="/glossary/?gl=37" title="The term &quot;majority&quot; is used in two ways in Parliament. Firstly a Government..." class="glossary">majority</a> of <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OECD">OECD</a> countries, by putting our world-class aid programme at the beating heart of our wider foreign policy decision-making, and doing it in a way that works best for the United Kingdom.</p> <p pid="b187.2/3">We are integrating and aligning the UK&#8217;s expertise as a development superpower with the reach and clout of our diplomatic network in order to ensure that their impact internationally is bigger than the sum of their parts. We have paved the way for this approach during covid, bringing together all the relevant strands of our international activity. For example, we joined our research efforts to find a vaccine at home with our international leadership in raising the funding to ensure equitable access for the most vulnerable countries, culminating in the <a href="/glossary/?gl=264" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prime_Minister_of_the_United_Ki ngdom" class="glossary">Prime Minister</a> hosting the Gavi summit and smashing the target by raising $8.8 billion in global vaccine funding. That amply demonstrates how our moral and national interests are inextricably intertwined.</p> <p pid="b187.2/4">We continue to bolster health systems in the most vulnerable countries, not just out of a sense of moral responsibility&#8212;although there is that&#8212;but also to safeguard the people of this country from a second wave of this deadly virus. It is in that spirit, as the new <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FCDO">FCDO</a> comes into operation today, that I can announce that the UK will commit a further &#163;119 million to tackle the combined threat of coronavirus and famine, so that we can do our bit to alleviate extreme hunger for over 6 million people from Yemen through to Sudan. In tandem with that, to leverage the impact of our national contribution, I have also today appointed <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nick_Dyer">Nick Dyer</a> as the UK&#8217;s special envoy for famine prevention and humanitarian affairs, again as we combine our aid impact with our diplomatic leadership to focus the world&#8217;s attention and rally international support to help tackle this looming disaster and threat.</p> <p pid="b187.2/5">The new Department reflects the drive towards a more effective and more joined-up foreign policy, and I pay tribute to the brilliant work of my right hon. Friend <a href="/mp/?p=25439" title="Our page on Anne-Marie Trevelyan - 'the Member for Berwick-upon-Tweed (Anne-Marie Trevelyan)'">Anne-Marie Trevelyan</a> and all her support directly in driving this merger forward. My team of Ministers has already been holding joint <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Department_for_International_Development">Department for International Development</a> and Foreign and <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commonwealth_Office">Commonwealth Office</a> portfolios for some time now, so we will have continuity as we bed in the organisation of the new Department. Sir Philip  Barton becomes the new permanent under-secretary at FCDO, the brilliant diplomat who co-ordinated the United Kingdom&#8217;s response to the Salisbury nerve agent attack back in 2018. We have also broadened the senior departmental leadership to achieve a more diverse range of expertise and experience at the top. So, as well as <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FCO">FCO</a> and <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DFID">DFID</a> experience, the board of directors general brings together those with wider experience from the Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy, Her Majesty&#8217;s Treasury and the <a href="/glossary/?gl=108" title="The cabinet is the group of twenty or so (and no more than 22) senior..." class="glossary">Cabinet</a> Office, not to mention from the private sector and the voluntary sector.</p> <p pid="b187.2/6">Abroad, we will operate with one voice and one line of reporting, so that all civil servants operating abroad, including our trade commissioners, will work to the relevant ambassador or high commissioner in post. Training the cadre of the new Department will be essential too, so the new <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Academy">International Academy</a> launched today will train and improve the skills of all our dedicated civil servants across Government who are working internationally. To boost this excellent team, I believe it is important to bring in additional insights from outside Government. Therefore, I have also appointed <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stefan_Dercon">Stefan Dercon</a>, professor of economic policy at <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oxford_University">Oxford University</a>, as my senior adviser on aid and development policy.</p> <p pid="b187.2/7">With the support of my tireless ministerial team, we continue to consult outside Government to test our thinking and glean new ideas for the successful operation of FCDO. I am grateful for the input we have received over the summer from hon. and right hon. Members across the House. In particular, my thanks go to the Chairs of the Foreign Affairs, International Development, and Defence Committees. I am also grateful for the advice I have had from non-governmental organisations, foundations and international organisations&#8212;from <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bill_Gates">Bill Gates</a> to <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Malpass">David Malpass</a>, the president of the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Bank">World Bank</a>, with whom I discussed matters yesterday.</p> <p pid="b187.2/8">We will reinforce that external scrutiny not just by maintaining <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ICAI">ICAI</a>&#8212;the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Independent_Commission_for_Aid_Impact">Independent Commission for Aid Impact</a>&#8212;but by strengthening its focus on the impact of our aid and the value added to our policy agenda, and by broadening its mandate to provide policy recommendations alongside its critical analysis. I am particularly grateful to my right hon. Friend <a href="/mp/?p=11115" title="Our page on Andrew Mitchell - 'the Member for Sutton Coldfield (Mr Mitchell)'">Mr Mitchell</a> for all his advice on this matter.</p> <p pid="b187.2/9">In this way, and informed in due course by the integrated review, the new Foreign, Commonwealth and Development Office will deliver on this Government&#8217;s mission to forge a truly global Britain to defend all aspects of the British national interest and to project this country as an even stronger force for good in the world.</p>            </div>

It has made a nonsense of his own review&#8212;the integrated Department has come before the integrated strategy. Thousands of staff with world-renowned expertise have been treated disgracefully, holding meetings in recent weeks with senior civil servants who cannot even answer basic questions about how this Department is going to operate. Why? Because the Government were shamed by a footballer into supporting some of the poorest children in this world. That does not bode well for a commitment to the poorest people across the planet.</p> <p pid="b188.0/2">The creation of the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Department_for_International_Development">Department for International Development</a>&#8212;the right hon. Gentleman knows&#8212;was a game changer not just for the world, but for Britain, and to put that at risk now is extraordinary. The world has never felt more unstable. We are in the midst of a global pandemic. We know that a vaccine will be successful only if it reaches the world&#8217;s poorest, and as the UK takes on the task of hosting <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/COP26">COP26</a> next year, the world is wondering what on earth is going on and whether Britain is capable of rising to the scale of the challenge.</p> <p pid="b188.0/3">The right hon. Gentleman did not give a commitment to retain the spending of 0.7%. I want to hear that commitment from him today. He also knows that the <a href="/glossary/?gl=264" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prime_Minister_of_the_United_Ki ngdom" class="glossary">Prime Minister</a> said, when he described <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DFID">DFID</a> as a</p> <p class="indent" pid="b188.0/4" pwmotiontext="yes">&#8220;giant cashpoint in the sky&#8221;,</p> <p pid="b188.0/5">that he would reassess the spending and the priorities of the Department. Today, the front pages of the papers say that the <a href="/glossary/?gl=170" title="The Chancellor - also known as &quot;Chancellor of the Exchequer&quot; is responsible..." class="glossary">Chancellor</a> is going to raid the right hon. Gentleman&#8217;s aid budget. The truth is he is losing this argument within his own <a href="/glossary/?gl=108" title="The cabinet is the group of twenty or so (and no more than 22) senior..." class="glossary">Cabinet</a>, so will he give me a cast-iron guarantee that there will be no changes to the International Development Act 2002? Will he tell us which country programmes have been identified for cuts? Where is the impact assessment and will he publish it? Where is the strategy that will guide allocation of resources? Can he confirm that <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ICAI">ICAI</a> will remain and that, crucially, it will remain independent? <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Foreign_Office">The Foreign Office</a> and other Departments do not have a good record on aid spending. This Government ought not to be allowed to mark their own homework.</p> <p pid="b188.0/6">The sad fact is that, instead of a strategy for Britain&#8217;s global role, we have got a new paint job on a Government plane. Where is the ambition? Where is the strategy? On a day when we have seen the United States pull out of global efforts to find a vaccine, the Prime <a href="/glossary/?gl=35" title="Ministers make up the Government and almost all are members of the House of..." class="glossary">Minister</a> is holed up in <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Downing_Street">Downing Street</a>, hiding from the world, where people wonder what on earth is going on. I do not envy him the mess that he has inherited, but he has to resolve it.

It was full of assertions and various snippets from media speculation in the newspapers. Let me try to give her some substantive answers. [Interruption.] She is saying that, but why doesn&#8217;t she listen? She asked about <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ICAI">ICAI</a> whereas, actually, we had already announced we were keeping and reinforcing it. I made the point in my statement; it seems that she is rehashing and rehearsing the critique that she wants to make without actually listening to what we are doing.</p> <p pid="b189.0/2">The hon. Lady asked in particular about the search for a vaccine. That is an excellent example of where we do need to bring together our world-beating aid leverage with our diplomatic clout. That is exactly what this <a href="/glossary/?gl=264" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prime_Minister_of_the_United_Ki ngdom" class="glossary">Prime Minister</a> did at the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GAVI">GAVI</a> summit&#8212;bringing countries together, smashing the target for global vaccine funding, which is a good complement and supplement to the research we are doing at Oxford, at Imperial and elsewhere not just to find a vaccine for the people of this country, but to ensure an equitable distribution around the world.</p> <p pid="b189.0/3">The hon. Lady asked about the 0.7%. The Prime <a href="/glossary/?gl=35" title="Ministers make up the Government and almost all are members of the House of..." class="glossary">Minister</a> has been very clear on this, and the new <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FCDO">FCDO</a> will put our world-class development programmes at the very heart of our foreign policy. The 0.7% commitment is a manifesto commitment, and it is enshrined in law. I would just gently point out to the hon. Lady that we have hit the 0.7% aid target in every year since 2013. She is right to say that it was Labour that introduced the target back in the &#8217;70s, but it never hit the target in any year. I think she should look at her own record before making assertions that, frankly, do not hold water.</p> <p pid="b189.0/4">The hon. Lady talked about a mess, but I do not think she has followed the detail of what we have done. The <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Order_in_Council">Order in Council</a> that we made today during the <a href="/glossary/?gl=9" title="The Privy Council goes back to the earliest days of the Monarchy, when it..." class="glossary">Privy Council</a> meeting will be laid in Parliament on <phrase class="date" code="2020-09-09">9 September</phrase> and will enter into force on <phrase class="date" code="2020-09-30">30 September</phrase>.

I thank him for his words of support for <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ICAI">ICAI</a>. It is important to have that external scrutiny. Frankly, as the <a href="/glossary/?gl=23" title="Secretary of State was originally the title given to the two officials who..." class="glossary">Secretary of State</a>&#8212;and having worked in a range of Departments&#8212;I think that scrutiny is useful for leveraging reform and getting the Department to look at new ways of doing things, so I remain open and embrace it. He asked me about the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Select_Committees">Select Committees</a>. Normally the process is that they <a href="/glossary/?gl=137" title="The shadow cabinet is the name given to the group of senior members from..." class="glossary">shadow</a> the individual Departments, but it will ultimately be a matter for the House.</p> <p pid="b191.1/2">I have heard the assertion that the Australian example demonstrates how it all goes horribly wrong. Having dug a little further and talked to my opposite number, Marise Payne, I do not think that that is necessarily the case. Although it is true that it is important to learn from the different ways in which different foreign ministries operate, there is only one in the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OECD">OECD</a> that still has a separate aid ministry with a separate aid budget. Actually, the movement&#8212;certainly in the last 10 or 15 years&#8212;has all been in the other way, so it is important to draw on  those lessons too. I am grateful for the hon.

She is absolutely right that we must look after the poorest. We have had an <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ODA">ODA</a> review because of the impact of coronavirus on the economy and on gross national income. We have  made it clear&#8212;I think this can give her the assurance she seeks&#8212;that we are absolutely committed, as we were in that review, to safeguarding the money for the very poorest, for girls&#8217; education and for <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/COP26">COP26</a> and our climate change goals. I agree with the hon. Lady about COP26. We are making sure that we use our aid money and our development expertise to provide 26 million people with access to clean energy and we are supporting farmers to grow climate-resilient crops. In all those ways, the bringing together of our development expertise with our Foreign Office reach and clout can show that we can have even greater impact in the months and years ahead.</p>            </div>

She is right that the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DAC">DAC</a> rules are an important part of the global infrastructure. There is plenty of scope, and it is absolutely right, for us to ensure that we get maximum value for British taxpayers&#8217; money and to drive a foreign policy that deals with some of the challenges we share with other countries around the world and fulfils our moral responsibilities but delivers for the British people here at home as well.</p>            </div>

He is absolutely right, and it is a good illustration of the rationale for this merger: as well as leading by example, we need to garner the international community to reinforce what we are doing, which is exactly why I have today appointed <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nick_Dyer">Nick Dyer</a> as the UK&#8217;s special envoy for famine prevention and humanitarian issues, to ensure that we are coaxing and cajoling other countries follow our lead.

We first met when he was giving expert evidence to the Yugoslavia tribunal. Indeed, I talked to <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Malcolm_Rifkind">Malcolm Rifkind</a> about precisely that model. Obviously, he had the experience of when the aid and development expertise were joined up with the previous <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FCO">FCO</a>. My hon. Friend is absolutely right. We will make sure that we have an integrated approach: our diplomatic network and reach combined with our aid expertise. I am bringing in some outside expertise, such as Professor Dercon, to make sure we get that right. There is a huge opportunity right across the world, including in that part of the world, to make sure we maximise our impact but not lose sight of the fact that we want our broader UK national interest to be reflected in the approach we take on development and aid.</p>            </div>

It is very welcome that the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foreign_Secretary">Foreign Secretary</a> said that that is not the case and he has a chance to prove this right now with regards to the covid-19 vaccine. What we are seeing is that the wealthiest countries are buying up lots and lots of the prospective doses, which is entirely natural if countries act as individuals, but if we want to globally tackle this horrendous virus, it is a very bad way to do it. So I wonder, in the spirit of global leadership, whether the Foreign Secretary could tell us what actions he is taking now for a just and medically beneficial approach to a global distribution of a vaccine of which we do not have enough doses yet?</p>            </div>

Obviously, the UK is seeking to lead at every level. We have the trials and the research that our world-beating scientists are undertaking, particularly Oxford and Imperial, but there are others as well. On top of that, one of things we have been working on, through our contributions both to  <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CEPI">CEPI</a>&#8212;the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coalition_for_Epidemic_Preparedness_Innovations">Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations</a>&#8212;and also through the Gavi summit, which I have already mentioned, is to make sure not only that we can pioneer and innovate a safe and usable vaccine, but that we can raise the money to make sure that there is a fair and just, equitable distribution. We want to make sure everyone in this country is immunised by this vaccine, but we also want to make sure that is true for other countries around the world. I think that is particularly important both for the moral reasons that, I think, he and I agree on, and for practical reasons, which is that it would safeguard us&#8212;Europe and the people of this country&#8212;from a second wave of the virus.</p>            </div>

We have made it very clear that we want to see full co-operation and engagement with that. We are looking very carefully at the outcome of it, and of course we will then be able to assess what we do on aid. He is absolutely right to raise the point, and I am hopefully in a position to give him the reassurance he needs.</p>            </div>

I think the hon. Member&#8217;s own Front-Bench team have accepted that. What I can tell her, though, is that we were very clear not just to salami slice budgets. So when I took the chairmanship of the review that we conducted with Departments across <a href="/glossary/?gl=101" title="Whitehall is a wide road that runs through the heart of Westminster,..." class="glossary">Whitehall</a>, we preserved focus and the funding for the bottom billion&#8212;the poverty reduction for the poorest around the world. We preserved and we made sure that we safeguarded the money prioritised for climate change, for girls&#8217; education, for covid-19 and also for a range of the &#8220;force for good&#8221; campaigns for media freedom and girls&#8217; education, as I have already mentioned, that I discuss, and in that way we have had a strategic approach. So, yes, we have had to review it in line with our commitment to adhere to a 0.7% pledge, but we have done it in a strategic way, and I think when she looks at the detail, she can be reassured.</p>            </div>

He knows that we have been working very hard on behalf of his constituent and I know that he has been a doughty champion of him. The broader point that he makes is right. We have a stronger impact in Yemen, bringing our aid influence with the diplomatic work that we are doing, working with UN Special Envoy Martin Griffiths, but also trying to alleviate the humanitarian plight and talking to all our international partners&#8212;<a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saudi_Arabia">Saudi Arabia</a>, the other countries of the region and the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Five_Eyes">Five Eyes</a>&#8212;to try to get this conflict resolved.

The fact that four out of five of the fastest-growing economies in the world are African, and that all 10 of the fastest-growing economies in the world are formerly developing countries, is in no small part thanks to Britain&#8217;s leadership. We did that not by being transactional with aid but by recognising that it was in our interests to do the right thing. Will the Foreign Secretary tell us how he will judge the success or failure of the new merged Department? If it does not match the achievements of DFID, will he have a rethink?</p>            </div>

He looks too young to have been hanging around the aid world for quite that long. He is right, and that is why the innovations that <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DFID">DFID</a> undertook at the time, which were right for the time, will be banked, kept and safeguarded within the new <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FCDO">FCDO</a>. There was a struggle to make the case for change back then, and it is worth being open-minded about the innovations that we can fuse, forge and meld together to get even greater value for money. I pay tribute to the work of DFID&#8217;s staff. I think we have an even greater opportunity, coupling our approach to liberal free trade, our development expertise, our diplomatic clout and our approach to conflict stabilisation, to deliver even greater outcomes. The hon.
