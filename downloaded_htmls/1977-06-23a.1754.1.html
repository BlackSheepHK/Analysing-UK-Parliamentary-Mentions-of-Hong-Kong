Agreement was reached yesterday on the main provisions of a new air services agreement. Final texts still have to be completed before the new agreement can be formally signed and come into effect. This will probably be at the end of next month. The agreement will then be laid before Parliament as a <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Command_Paper">Command Paper</a>. Meanwhile, services will continue as at present.</p> <p>
The most important and novel feature of the new agreement is the mechanism to control capacity on <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_Atlantic">North Atlantic</a> routes. This is designed to reduce the waste of fuel and other resources that results from flying too many empty seats, while preserving competition and benefiting the travelling public. This has from the outset been one of our most important objectives.</p> <p>
Moreover, our airlines will be able to open up new routes to the United States. The new points are Houston, Atlanta, Seattle and <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dallas-Fort_Worth">Dallas-Fort Worth</a>, and a non-stop route to <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/San_Francisco">San Francisco</a>. These routes will enable us to increase our penetration of the North Atlantic market. We have also got a better route across the Pacific for future passenger and cargo services from <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hong_Kong">Hong Kong</a> to the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/West_Coast_of_the_United_States">West Coast of the United States</a>.</p> <p>
We have also secured agreement to single designation by both sides on all the North Atlantic routes except two. This means that with these exceptions the British carrier will face competition from only one American airline. <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Americans">The Americans</a> will be putting two airlines on <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York">New York</a> and <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Los_Angeles">Los Angeles</a>. My intention is to designate Laker as our second carrier to New York. We shall


retain the option to designate a second carrier on some other route. I intend to keep this open.</p> <p>
We have obtained substantial reductions in the rights of United States airlines to carry fifth freedom traffic beyond London and Hong Kong to other destinations, although some important fifth freedom rights will continue. A number of these rights will disappear immediately, others after three and five years.</p> <p>
There will also be greater flexibility for the airlines, our own as well as the American, to carry passengers on the same aircraft to more than one destination but without the right to pick up passengers from one destination point and take them to another. This is a new concept which should contribute to more economic use of resources. But we have given notice to the United States authorities that if it turned out to our disadvantage we would want to review it.</p> <p>
A new tariffs article has been agreed which removes the ambiguities of the old tariffs article and should avoid the disputes that have occured in the past.</p> <p>
It has also been agreed that, in accordance with my airports policy statement of 5th April, the new routes to Houston and Atlanta will from the start come into Gatwick. This will also apply to the Dallas route, provided that the British carrier uses Gatwick.</p> <p>
New routes have also been agreed linking Bermuda and our dependencies in the Caribbean to the United States.</p> <p>
Finally, the Americans have agreed to work with us towards a new multilateral arrangement on charter services between North America and Europe. We already have a bilateral arrangement with the United States, which is working well. This will now become part of the new air services agreement. The development of charter services, which both sides desire to foster, will offer further benefits to the travelling public.</p> <p>
I believe that this agreement will open a new and expanding era. It will provide significant new opportunities for the airlines of both sides and promises real benefits to the consumer. It will give British airlines a fairer opportunity to fight for a bigger share of a growing market.</p>            </div>

Secondly, may I ask the right hon. Gentleman whether, with the benefit of hindsight, he still thinks that he was right to abrogate the agreement in the manner and at the time he did last year? Does he not think that many of the advantages which he has obtained from this arrangement could have been obtained without the brinkmanship which arose?</p> <p>
Thirdly, has he ever known any cartel, whether an industrial one or a Government one, as in this case, which has in the end proved of greater benefit to the consumer&#8212;and I am talking of the airline users in this case&#8212;than the free play of competition?</p>            </div>

Member on posing those questions rather than making the silly and, may I say, ignorant statement that he issued to the Press yesterday. As to a debate, that is a matter for my right hon. Friend the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lord_President">Lord President</a>, but I will speak to him about it because I should be very glad to have a debate.</p> <p>
The hon. Member asks whether I was right to denounce the previous agreement and to do so at the time I chose. Yes, I was right to do so. I have gained benefits from doing so. The time was carefully calculated. My own view of negotiations of this kind with major commercial interests involved is that the final agreement should and could be concluded only at a time of crunch. Whether that had happened in the last few days, in six months' time or in three months' time would not have made any difference at all to the situation. The timing was right, and we have gained from what has been done.</p> <p>
As to a cartel, the hon. Gentleman speaks as though the airlines operated in a free market. He should wake up to the situation that the operations of airlines are subject to Government agreements. What we have been trying to do and have


succeeded in doing in this agreement is to improve the conditions from our point of view. That could be done only by the Government's intervening to denounce the previous agreement and to negotiate a new one. We have done that successfully.</p>            </div>

I was very glad to see on the tapes last night that the Chairman of Pan-Am, while conceding that there had been a transfer of economic benefits from the United States flag to the British flag, said he welcomed the fact that a framework had been created within which both sides could operate. That was what we were trying to do, and we succeeded.</p>            </div>

As for the hon. Gentleman's suggestion that there is some inequity in the solo rights for three years granted to United States airlines as against <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/British_Caledonian">British Caledonian</a> at Houston, taking the national position overall, including Manchester, and the relative value of these points, we were of the opinion that this was a reasonable deal. I should also say that we were asked by British Caledonian to obtain for it solo rights at Houston for a period during which it could build up that traffic. That was a very difficult demand to satisfy but we satisfied it and we have, therefore, provided British Caledonian with a very significant selling point as well as, through the system of capacity control, enabling it, when it goes into Atlanta, to go in with some prospect of success.</p> <p>
As for the route to the West Coast, this is something which the associates in <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hong_Kong">Hong Kong</a> wanted. They wish to develop it for a period and they think this is a valuable route to have been included in the agreement.</p> <p>
As regards the working of the capacity control mechanism, this derives, first, from the existing situation and, secondly, from estimates made by airlines as to the capacity that should be provided during the next similar period, with provisions for a fall-back mechanism in the agreement. This is a mechanism which obviously has to be seen in some detail, and no doubt when the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Command_Paper">Command Paper</a> is before the House the hon. Gentleman will want to examine the details.</p>            </div>

be any greater choice? Will there be any better services which we have not had so far?</p> <p>

The first is that in our judgment and according to our calculations&#8212;I have not seen these challenged, and I believe that the United States accepts them&#8212;the savings in the waste of energy and of capacity flying across the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_Atlantic">North Atlantic</a> should eventually lead to lower fares in real terms. What consumers want in transatlantic travel is lower fares in real terms. They do not want empty seats. The other element in the better provision for consumers is the additional gateways into the United States that we have as a result of the agreement.</p> <p>
On the question of a second British carrier, in our judgment <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Los_Angeles">Los Angeles</a> is not at the moment worthy of dual designation because the amount of traffic does not justify it. It is open to us to select a point in the United States at the time we wish for dual designation. That is a matter that we now have to consider, and that is an option that I must keep open for the time being.</p> <p>
The hon. Gentleman referred to <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/British_Caledonian">British Caledonian</a> being adversely affected. I am prepared to go into that matter in detail, if necessary, but it is not true that the agreement adversely affects British Caledonian. The agreement is beneficial to British Caledonian on terms far better than the company could have expected to achieve and certainly better than would have been achieved under the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bermuda_Agreement">Bermuda Agreement</a>.</p>            </div>

Friend will appreciate that the number of passengers who travel on airlines within a system of single or dual designation will depend on the competitiveness of the airlines. I cannot command the relative competitiveness of particular airlines. The combination rights granted under this agreement will enable American airlines, without taking on new passengers at London, to go forward from London to other destinations. We have similar rights in the opposite direction. I am coming nowhere near to saying that the agreement results in a fifty-fifty splitting of passengers. We have tried to give British airlines a better opportunity to get a fairer share of this relatively rapidly rising market.</p>            </div>

The prospects for Concorde at <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York">New York</a> in the immediate future depend on the results of court proceedings now in progress in the United States.

Friend is no doubt aware of the very large losses made by American airlines on the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York">New York</a> route. One achievement of the agreement is that passengers will obtain better fares in real terms. It is no use the <a href="/glossary/?gl=29" title="The Opposition are the political parties in the House of Commons other than..." class="glossary">Opposition</a> trying to pretend that this is a free market. The hon. Member for St. Ives (Mr. Nott) is perhaps new to this subject and does not understand the element of control on the civil aviation scene. That no doubt led him to make the curious remarks that he thought it right to make yesterday. We are dealing with a situation in which Governments are involved. In my judgment of that situation, Governments should support their national airlines as well as protect the interests of consumers.</p>            </div>

He should see the combination rights against the background of the cancellation of the significant fifth freedom rights which United States airlines had. Some of those are immediately cancelled. But those being operated from this country are to be cancelled in a phased way. It is against that background that the combination rights have to be seen. We have certain equivalent combination rights. Nevertheless, combination rights could be a cost to this country which would have to be set off against the benefits.</p> <p>
I said in my statement, as we said in the course of the negotiations, that we would watch the operation of these combination rights carefully. If they operate to our disadvantage, this is a matter which we shall wish to discuss under the consultation provisions of the new agreement.</p>            </div>

the statement by the hon. Member for St. Ives yesterday. He seemed to think that charters operated in a free market. We have done well in charters because there is a favourable agreement with the United States governing their operation. That agreement is now incorporated in a sense into this new agreement, but it is likely to be continued with its favourable elements as a result of the new agreement. Therefore, the point that the hon. Gentleman made yesterday about charters is another example of his entire ignorance of the subject.</p>            </div>

My hon. Friend asked me whether we had made any calculations as to the rate of return on British capital invested in the airlines. The calculations which we have made so far show that there are likely to be beneficial results to the British airlines in revenue terms arising from this agreement, but these must necessarily be highly speculative. The result will depend on the competitiveness of the United Kingdom airlines, and the return on capital will depend on the rate at which they exploit their new opportunities.</p>            </div>

We had always understood that this was what he was out to achieve. There is double designation on two main routes.
