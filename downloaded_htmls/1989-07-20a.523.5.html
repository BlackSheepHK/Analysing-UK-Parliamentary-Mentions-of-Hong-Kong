Do the Government propose changing the business for next week to give the House the opportunity to debate the general practitioners' overwhelming rejection, in a ballot, of the contract that the Government wanted them to accept? When deciding what to do, will the right hon. Gentleman recall that, after the <a href="/glossary/?gl=23" title="Secretary of State was originally the title given to the two officials who..." class="glossary">Secretary of State</a> for Health thought that he had reached an agreement, he rushed to the House on <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Friday">Friday</a> 5 May like a dog with two tails? Will the right hon. and learned Gentleman come back to the House now that the doctors have docked the tail? He said that the agreement that he thought that he had reached was
<q>a very significant step in the development of the family doctor service".&#8212;[<i>Official Report,</i> 5 May 1989; Vol. 152, c. 480.]</q>
Clearly that step has been halted and the House is entitled to know what the right hon. and learned Gentleman intends doing next.</p> <p>
Moving from health generally to health in Wales, the Leader of the House will recall that my right hon. and hon. Friends from Wales have been pressing for a statement on the impact of the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Health_Service">National Health Service</a> review on Wales, or a debate in the House or the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Welsh_Grand_Committee">Welsh Grand Committee</a>. Has any progress been made?</p> <p>
When are we likely to get the long-promised debate on the Government's proposal to substitute student loans for student grants?</p> <p>
Whether or not the Leader of the House is with us in this incarnation next <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thursday">Thursday</a>, can he tell us whether he has made some progress towards establishing a <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Select_Committee_on_Scottish_Affairs">Select Committee on Scottish Affairs</a>, to which the people of Scotland are entitled both by right and by our Standing Orders? If the right hon. Gentleman will not be in that incarnation next Thursday, will he tell his successor that Scottish Members will not rest satisfied until they have such a Select Committee?</p>            </div>

                                  <div class="debate-speech__content">                <p>The hon. Gentleman asked me four questions about next week's business. First, he asked me whether my right hon. and learned Friend the <a href="/glossary/?gl=23" title="Secretary of State was originally the title given to the two officials who..." class="glossary">Secretary of State</a> for Health would be making a statement about the general practitioner contract ballot result. The answer is no. My right hon. and learned Friend regrets the GPs' decision not to support their own negotiators and to reject the contract agreed with the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BMA">BMA</a> on 4 May. Those negotiations were hard fought and concessions were made by both sides to ensure a fair deal which could bring forward further improvements to patient care. My right hon. and learned Friend is consulting the BMA's general medical services committee leaders on detailed regulations to implement the contract agreed on 4 May and will lay those before Parliament in the autumn. Good GPs have nothing to fear from the new contract which will reward doctors who provide the service that patients want and need.</p> <p>
A number of right hon. and hon. Gentlemen have asked questions about the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Health_Service">National Health Service</a> in Wales. My right hon. Friend the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secretary_of_State_for_Wales">Secretary of State for Wales</a> and officials in his Department have had extensive discussions with a wide range of interests on the <a href="/glossary/?gl=220" title="A document issued by the Government laying out its policy, or proposed..." class="glossary">White Paper</a> "Working for Patients" and in particular on the Welsh chapter. My right hon. Friend will be writing soon to health interests in Wales reporting on the outcome of the discussions and the next steps. He will make that publicly available. That is the procedure adopted by my right hon. and learned Friend the Secretary of State for Health.</p> <p>
On top-up loans for students, we made it clear that we would be happy for the House to debate the Government's plans and the <a href="/glossary/?gl=29" title="The Opposition are the political parties in the House of Commons other than..." class="glossary">Opposition</a>'s pledge to deprive students of the opportunity to add to their resources. The timing of such a debate is a matter for discussion through the usual channels.</p> <p>
The hon. Gentleman knows that the question of the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Select_Committee_on_Scottish_Affairs">Select Committee on Scottish Affairs</a> is difficult. I have nothing further to add to what I said a little while ago.</p>            </div>

I am grateful to him for removing the Leeds orders which will be debated next <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tuesday">Tuesday</a>. Does he accept that we can raise issues relating to development corporations only in the House and that they cannot be dealt with locally? Should we not have a Committee of the House on the development corporations similar to the Committee on <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Northern_Ireland">Northern Ireland</a> legislation, following the removal of local authority powers there, so that we can raise issues with Ministers regularly? We cannot do so locally because local authority powers have been removed.</p>            </div>

He is a Chinese journalist with the New China Press Agency in <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hong_Kong">Hong Kong</a>. He came to Britain after making statements condemning the assassinations in Beijing and was granted leave to stay until 30 June 1990. According to statements, he returned to Hong Kong voluntarily. This case raises disturbing aspects: first, the appearance of threatening advertisements in the Chinese business newspaper that is published in Soho; secondly, the disclosure of escape routes of Hong Kong dissidents that will result from his return to Hong Kong; and thirdly, the fear that it will

create among the Chinese community in Britain. I interviewed this gentleman last week, and he was nervous and distraught about his status in this country and his lack of a travel document. In those circumstances, does the Leader of the House agree that the <a href="/glossary/?gl=35" title="Ministers make up the Government and almost all are members of the House of..." class="glossary">Minister</a> of State, <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Home_Office">Home Office</a> should make a statement about his return and its consequences for the Chinese community in Britain and other dissidents?</p>            </div>

The gentleman concerned, who is a Chinese national, was granted leave to enter the United Kingdom on 30 June. On 17 <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/July">July</a>, he contacted his embassy in London and asked to return to China. On his departure from the United Kingdom he was interviewed in private by an immigration officer, when he confirmed that he was returning to China of his own free will. He appeared calm and well and expressed himself clearly. There was, therefore, neither power nor reason to prevent this gentleman's departure.</p>            </div>

Should not the House and the people of Britain be concerned that the visit on <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/July">July</a>, which the right hon. Gentleman mentioned, was the fourth visit that Mr. Xu Hai Ning had made to the embassy? On three occasions he had changed his mind about returning to China. It was the pressure of advertisements in the Chinese business press and the harassment and threats to his family that finally forced him to return.</p> <p>
Should not the Home Office be concerned that the safe houses provided by the Chinese Solidarity Campaign&#8212;which I thought the Government would have contacted on this case&#8212;have not only been broken into, but have been visited by Chinese secret service personnel? What hope can people of Chinese extraction have that this country will act as a place of refuge if someone can be forced to return under duress by the tactics used on Mr. Xu Hai Ning? Should not we have a statement on this matter?</p>            </div>

The motion relates to the pay rises of the chairmen of privatised companies and has been signed by 74 hon. Members. It describes the rises as "extravagant and obscene". Will the Leader of the House condemn those pay increases and arrange for a statement to be made next week on this important matter?</p>            </div>

We are aware that the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WDA">WDA</a> is contracting out legal services, publicity and information.

Is he aware that as a result of last night's "Panorama" programme on <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BBC">BBC</a> television, the public are demanding that the matter be raised in Parliament? If Parliament is not for debating matters of extreme public interest, what is it for? I have a special interest in the matter, because of the way in which the Government and the Tories of the time treated my brothers and their colleagues on <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clay_Cross">Clay Cross</a> council, who did nothing other than refuse to raise rents. The Government were also prepared to surcharge Lambeth and Liverpool councillors. Why is it that there is one law for <a href="/glossary/?gl=135" title="The political party system in the English-speaking world evolved in the..." class="glossary">Tory</a> councillors and for friends of the <a href="/glossary/?gl=264" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prime_Minister_of_the_United_Ki ngdom" class="glossary">Prime Minister</a> such as Lady Porter, and another law for Labour councillors?
