The <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WTO">WTO</a> is the means by which that fair balance can be pursued. <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/In_2001">In 2001</a>, at Doha, the WTO placed a strong emphasis on helping the developing countries to take a larger part in world trade. It is at Hong Kong in a few weeks' time that the final stage of the Doha agenda should be resolved&#8212;or at least a framework resolved for completion of the round in 2006.</p> <p pid="c.307.7/3">What, therefore, should the Hong Kong meeting aim for? What can it reasonably achieve? What will remain to be done? In considering those questions today, the House is greatly assisted by the report on the next WTO meeting, published by the International Trade Sub-Committee of the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_Union_Committee">European Union Committee</a> of your Lordships' House, chaired by the noble Lord, <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lord_Radice">Lord Radice</a>. There are many problems to be identified and many solutions to be resolved. It is essential, is it not, that in engaging in that task those present in Hong Kong should eschew rhetoric, avoid the pressure of the last minute and negotiate to the hilt in the manner that so disastrously failed in Cancun? After five years there should be time for careful, detailed reflection.</p> <p pid="c.307.7/4">In considering what will happen, let us start with our position in the United Kingdom. It has been and probably always will be our destiny to be a trading nation. We are the eighth largest exporter in the world and in the year ending 2004 the total of our exports was &#163;190 billion. We are the second largest exporter in the world of services, and &#163;80 billion of that &#163;190 billion reflects the value of our services exports. Hong Kong and its aftermath are vital to our trading health.</p> <p pid="c.307.7/5">The present Government have pursued all along a fair, reasonable and positive policy towards WTO reform and the Doha agenda in particular. It is inevitable, is it not, that in Hong Kong our ministerial team will be looked to, either publicly or in private, for that sense of measured and fair compromise which the world expects from the British? We wish our ministerial team well. They, of course, will support the European objective, but they should not default on their national commitment to represent our interests, as required.</p> <p pid="c.307.7/6">The Doha agenda remains. The <a href="/glossary/?gl=37" title="The term &quot;majority&quot; is used in two ways in Parliament. Firstly a Government..." class="glossary">majority</a> of its member countries and populations are from the developing world. As the draft ministerial text issued this week states, its needs and interests are at the heart of the Doha agenda. Paragraph 1 of that text rehearses, proclaims and shares a determination to fulfil that agenda. What is the main issue? It is agriculture. There must be an opening on that issue first and foremost in Hong Kong&#8212;at least a framework, if not a final decision&#8212;and the two most interested parties from the developed world are the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_and_the_European_Union">United States and the European Union</a>.</p> <p pid="c.307.7/7"><a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_United_States">The United States</a> has taken an extremely strong protectionist line in the cotton industry&#8212;I use that by way of example. It is remarkable to find that in 1999 to 2005 US subsidies to its cotton producers amounted to 86 per cent of the total value of the product&#8212;or $17 billion. Eighty per cent of that total was paid to fewer than 3,000 enterprises. It is an imbalance compared with Burkina Faso, Benin, Chad and Mali that borders on the grotesque. It cannot possibly be justified, save on the express basis of protectionism. If we in the developed world are to move away from protectionism, cotton allows the United States an extremely good first way in which to illustrate that move.</p> <p pid="c.307.7/8">At the moment, as we know only too well, agriculture accounts for 2 per cent of the European Union's product, but it occupies 40 per cent of the Union's budget. How can that possibly be justified? The two units&#8212;the United States and Europe&#8212;give $50 billion in aid and $350 billion in agricultural subsidies. That cannot possibly be allowed to continue. To preach&#8212;I use the word pejoratively&#8212;to the developing world that it must adapt to free trade when we maintain such regimes borders on the hypocritical. That is why at Doha the developed world realised its duty&#8212;probably a greater duty towards world trade than that owed by the smaller, less developed and poorer countries.</p> <p pid="c.307.7/9">What, therefore, is achievable in agriculture? The first principle&#8212;I hope that noble Lords will forgive me for the trite comment&#8212;is negotiation. Difficult though it is in public, if a position is put but is not met with a response, that is not negotiation. At the moment, the United States has put forward a large offer in terms of cutting subsidies. <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_European_Union">The European Union</a> has put up its third offer in recent months, now approaching 39 per cent. The question is: is it enough? At the very least, it calls for a response, particularly from countries such as Brazil and India, which enjoy new economic strengths and domestically strong agricultural markets.</p> <p pid="c.307.7/10">I shall give a few technical examples of how one can approach negotiation on this front step by step. The European Union subsidy regime dedicates up to $5 billion to export incentive or relief. It is not much, but it is a start. The $350 billion can be divided up and serve to produce a subset of $100 billion which is related to production and trade subsidy&#8212;what is called coupled arrangements. That is a second step. Some of it is surely open to negotiation. Coupling that with the 39 per cent provides a beginning. In these negotiations on agriculture, whether it be cotton, sugar or textiles, there are bound to be losers, countries that cannot compete with a free trade regime and whose needs must be met. The WTO has recognised that.</p> <p pid="c.307.7/11">So agriculture comes first. It is simply illogical and of no negotiating strength to say to poor countries around the world, "You accept our offer on agriculture and open up your markets to us. That is the deal". That is not a deal, but it is the beginning of negotiation. There are other smaller features, very important in their context, which Commissioner Mandelson has put on the table: medicinal products, relief from the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TRIPS">TRIPS</a> regime in relation to drug access for those in need in the developed world, compensation for loss of access to markets such as for the sugar countries that I have mentioned already and cotton which I have also mentioned. Then there are the least developed countries. Paragraph 28 of a ministerial text of this week says:</p> <p class="indent" pid="c.307.7/12">"we agree to fully implement duty-free and quota-free market access for products originating from LDCs by the end of the Round in a manner that ensures security and predictability".</p> <p pid="c.307.7/13">Let us stand by that promise. The last thing that can be achieved is building capacity for trade.</p> <p pid="c.307.7/14">Finally, what of the longer term? World trade bespeaks a world agenda, not a Western economic unit, dealing with the rest of the world&#8212;a world agenda. The points I make for a longer-term debate and reform are as follows. First, the least developed countries and small economies must continue to get help. There is no equality between the rich man in his mansion and the poor man at the gate, but there can be an equitable sharing that benefits both. Secondly, commodity-dependent countries must be protected against short-term profit which is not accompanied by long-term investment. Thirdly, trade relates to debt and debt to finance&#8212;all three go together. Fourthly, there is no outreach of any consequence between the world trade system, parliaments and civil society. It is far too technical and it is not explained enough to those, like us, who, from time to time, have to legislate about it. That cannot continue. There should be regional trade agreements to give local strength as part of the world picture.</p> <p pid="c.307.7/15">Fifthly, there should be technical assistance. It is an uninspiring phrase but it is vital. Those who want to trade internationally have to be trained to trade internationally to protect themselves. It is lamentable that the technical assistance document from the WTO of recent months complains that its members, usually us, the rich, are not paying their dues and the 2006 technical assistance plan may founder. We all pay about $90 million to support the WTO for a trade regime that involves trillions. How on earth can we not spend more money on helping those we want to help us to benefit our people as well as theirs?</p> <p pid="c.307.7/16">Lastly, I commend to the House the book <i>Just World</i>, which was published by the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fabian_Society">Fabian Society</a> last summer. It is not written on a party political basis, but on the basis of what the world needs. It is sensible, pragmatic and worth pursuing.</p> <p pid="c.307.7/17">The net result is that we cannot afford failure at the meeting in Hong Kong. It must start towards success, possibly with an extraordinary meeting in six months' time. <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_CBI">The CBI</a> has it right: at Hong Kong, and soon after, it is vital that the authority and credibility of the WTO is reinforced. I have every confidence that our Government will do the best they can to ensure that the authority of the WTO is maintained. I beg to move for Papers.</p>            </div>

                                  <div class="debate-speech__content">                <p pid="c.310.0/1">My Lords, I congratulate my noble friend on his excellent speech and thank him for allowing the report of my sub-committee to be discussed during his debate. It was a happy conjunction of events that my noble friend put forward for debate the subject of the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WTO">WTO</a> and the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hong_Kong">Hong Kong</a> ministerial and my committee completed its report on the same subject last week and received the support of the main EU committee on Tuesday. Knowing that this topic was to be debated today, I asked my noble friend whether our report could "piggyback" on his debate, and he was kind enough to agree. I think it is in line with the Puttnam report, which sensibly suggested that topical issues should, if possible, be debated topically. A report on the Hong Kong ministerial that has printed on its front the date "13th-18th December" has a limited shelf-life, so we are grateful to my noble friend <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lord_Brennan">Lord Brennan</a> and to the usual channels that we have been given this opportunity to discuss our report in this debate.</p> <p pid="c.310.0/2">Noble Lords will recall that in June 2004, the European Union Select Committee published a report on the role of the EU in the WTO organisation, following the disastrous collapse of the ministerial meeting at Cancun. In that report, we strongly argued the case for further trade liberalisation for all countries, including developing countries. It is in their interest as well as that of rich countries. Despite the failure of Cancun, we believe that it is right to continue to support the main commitments of the Doha declaration of November 2001. As noble Lords will remember, it promised the fundamental reform of agricultural support and access, the reduction of non-tariff barriers and special attention to the needs and interests of developing countries. In our 2004 report, we made a number of recommendations that we hoped would get the Doha round back on track. They included an EU commitment to phase out agricultural export subsidies, more flexibility from the EU on reductions in agricultural tariffs, reductions in industrial tariffs&#8212;that is called <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NAMA">NAMA</a>&#8212;and making real progress in reducing trade in services. For the convenience of the House, the conclusions of our previous report are published in Appendix 3 of our report on the Hong Kong ministerial.</p> <p pid="c.310.0/3">Given the importance of the Hong Kong ministerial as a staging post to a successful Doha round, we decided to undertake a short follow-up inquiry and report. As we did not have much time, we did not take full evidence, as we had previously, but we took oral evidence from the Minster for Trade and from <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roger_Liddle">Roger Liddle</a>, adviser to the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/EU_Trade_Commissioner">EU Trade Commissioner</a>, <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peter_Mandelson">Peter Mandelson</a>. We also received some written evidence, including from Oxfam, <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christian_Aid">Christian Aid</a> and the Food and Drink Federation. I should like to thank our Clerk and our specialist adviser for their contributions and my colleagues for their hard work and co-operation.</p> <p pid="c.310.0/4">We begin by urging governments to work for a conclusion of the Doha round by the end of 2006. In our previous report we talked about the beginning of 2006, but, clearly, that is not on the agenda today. It is very important that the round is finished by the end of 2006, because there is only a narrow window of opportunity before political and legislative factors&#8212;above all, the end of the US fast-track authority in 2007&#8212;come into play. So, if the round is to be completed, we must get our skates on.</p> <p pid="c.310.0/5">In our report, we also note the changed landscape of negotiations with the emergence of potential economic superpowers&#8212;China, India and other countries such as Brazil. They have formed themselves into a <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/G20">G20</a> group. There is also the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/G90">G90</a> group of the least developed countries. They are a welcome innovation as they help to ensure that the WTO negotiations cannot be accused merely of representing the interests of the rich countries, but they also represent the interests of developing and the least developed countries. However&#8212;this is the other side of the coin&#8212;with the increased power to influence the outcome comes responsibility, because it does take two to tango. Just as the EU and the United States, as my noble friend said, must be prepared to put realistic offers on the table, so in the end the G20 and the G90 must be prepared to respond constructively if we are to get a successful Doha round. That is obvious, but it needs saying.</p> <p pid="c.310.0/6">In our report we discuss how progress can be made at Hong Kong. We accept, as does my noble friend Lord Brennan, that agriculture is the key to unlocking the Doha round. But if a successful round is to be achieved, there must also be movement on the reduction of industrial tariffs. That is in the interests not only of the rich countries and the developing countries, but also of opening up markets in services. I know that my noble friend wants to say something about services later on.</p> <p pid="c.310.0/7">On the vital issue of market access, we support the EU's offer&#8212;it is the third offer, as my noble friend said&#8212;to reduce tariffs by 38.9 per cent as being very much a move in the right direction. Of course we expect the EU to lower tariffs further over time, as the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CAP">CAP</a> reforms kick in and, one hopes, gather momentum. But an EU offer that is higher than that of the Uruguay round is a serious offer and it deserves a serious response. Now we need to see the hand of those other countries that in a sense have been hiding behind the lack of a serious offer from the EU. It has now made a serious offer; now let us see what the others are going to say.</p> <p pid="c.310.0/8">I should make a point here: not all developing countries, by any means, are in favour of agriculture liberalisation. The ACP countries in particular, as we have seen over the reform of the sugar regime, are understandably very concerned about the erosion of their preferences into EU markets. We consider in our report that it is very important to ensure that these countries do not lose out disproportionately; hence the case for transaction measures, including aid, as compensation. The WTO will need to return to this issue if we are to get a successful conclusion of the round.</p> <p pid="c.310.0/9">I should like to make a more general point. It picks up on a remark made by Peter Mandelson yesterday to the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_Parliament">European Parliament</a>. He said&#8212;and this is a sensible point:</p> <p class="indent" pid="c.310.0/10">"This is a development round, it is not an agricultural exporters round. The two should not be confused".</p> <p pid="c.310.0/11">Some countries such as Brazil will do well out of the lowering of agricultural tariffs. They stand to gain a lot from this, but that is not so true of other countries. Those that stand to gain very much from this need to respond when an offer is made by the EU.</p> <p pid="c.310.0/12">On agricultural export subsidies, we support the EU's offer to remove them, provided others follow suit. We can at least aim for the date of 2010 suggested by the Commission on Africa, which the Government have backed. On that issue, the ball is now in the court of other WTO members.</p> <p pid="c.310.0/13">So on those two issues, the EU has moved very much in the direction that we suggested in our report in 2004. If significant progress can be made on agriculture, that should open the way for reductions in industrial tariffs and movement on service liberalisation. We have here the outline of a grand bargain but, so far, there has been little movement on industrial tariffs on the other side. <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_UK">The UK</a> trade <a href="/glossary/?gl=35" title="Ministers make up the Government and almost all are members of the House of..." class="glossary">Minister</a> told us that it would be very helpful if there was now on offer from countries such as Brazil and India. He said:</p> <p class="indent" pid="c.310.0/14">"I do not speak Portuguese, but if you read the Brazilian newspapers"&#8212;</p> <p pid="c.310.0/15">I presume that someone translated them for him&#8212;</p> <p class="indent" pid="c.310.0/16">"it is quite clear that they have got an offer on non-agricultural market access in their back pocket".</p> <p pid="c.310.0/17">They ought to show their hand. We ought to see the colour of their money.</p> <p pid="c.310.0/18">What are the realistic prospects for the Hong Kong ministerial round? Roger Liddle told us when he gave evidence that trade ministers had reached a,</p> <p class="indent" pid="c.310.0/19">"consensus that it was not possible to get decisive progress without lowering expectations for Hong Kong".</p> <p pid="c.310.0/20">That is a somewhat complicated sentence. I think he was pointing to the fact that we will not get detailed modalities&#8212;I think that that is the technical phrase, which I know the Minister understands very well&#8212;in the key areas of negotiation now at Hong Kong. There is not time for that.</p> <p pid="c.310.0/21">However, we must at least avoid a Cancun-type disaster. After Hong Kong, we need to be in a position to move to complete the Doha round successfully by the end of 2006. At the least, Hong Kong needs to put us in a position to do that. It would be a disaster if the Doha round was to break down. Multilateral negotiations would be seen to have failed and the temptation would be to abandon multilateralism in favour of bilateral and regional agreements. As we stated in our report, it would be a paradox if a breakdown of the Doha round led to bilateral and regional agreements between the major trading blocs&#8212;the EU and the United States and, yes, including <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/China_and_India">China and India</a> perhaps&#8212;from which developing countries could well be excluded, to their considerable detriment.</p> <p pid="c.310.0/22">One statistic that is often cited&#8212;in a sense, it is a clich&#233;, but it is worth repeating&#8212;is that if Africa could secure a 1 per cent increase in its share of world trade, that would account for seven times more than all the world aid that goes to the continent. Therefore, we believe that it is all the more important for developed and developing countries to work for a constructive Hong Kong ministerial and a successful Doha development round.</p>            </div>

                                  <div class="debate-speech__content">                <p pid="c.313.0/1">My Lords, first, I warmly congratulate the noble Lords, <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lord_Brennan">Lord Brennan</a> and <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lord_Radice">Lord Radice</a>, on bringing about this debate and on their admirable contributions with which I overwhelmingly agree. The importance of achieving a successful conclusion to the Doha round needs no underlining. But I am afraid that it has been long apparent that the ambition of <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pascal_Lamy">Pascal Lamy</a> to conclude two-thirds of the negotiations by or at the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hong_Kong">Hong Kong</a> round would not be met. We are now engaged in a process of damage limitation and of lowering expectations. Of course, that need not necessarily be a tragedy. The history of international trade negotiations has included many setbacks from which there have later been advances. Perhaps the most spectacular was the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heysel_Stadium">Heysel Stadium</a> which was supposed to bring the Uruguay round to a conclusion, but which led to complete fiasco. Ultimately, the round was brought to a successful conclusion.</p> <p pid="c.313.0/2">However, as has been pointed out, there is one important difference. The expiry of what used to be called "fast track", but what I now understand has to be called the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trade_Promotion_Authority">Trade Promotion Authority</a> for the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Administration">United States Administration</a>, on <phrase class="date" code="2007-07-01">1 July 2007</phrase> means that there is an effective date by which agreement has to be reached because, I regret to say, in the current state of the US political scene, the prospects of securing a renewal of that authority, which in other circumstances on other occasions would have been possible, now seems extremely remote. So it is essential to press on with determination, combined with realism, to achieve what can be achieved at Hong Kong and to use that as a platform and a spur to completing the round in the rest of the year.</p> <p pid="c.313.0/3">I am not at all surprised but I am very glad that both speakers did not do what much of the British press has done in recent weeks and months; that is, try to blame all the difficulties on the European Union. I say that not because once, some time ago, I was responsible in the European Union for those matters, but because such a criticism would not be justified. I strongly favour further reform of a common agricultural policy going substantially beyond what has so far been done.</p> <p pid="c.313.0/4">None the less, the noble Lord, Lord Radice, is absolutely right that the European Union has put a substantial offer on the table. <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/In_July">In July</a>, it pledged to end export subsidies on agriculture. In October, action was taken on market access with an offer to reduce the highest tariffs by 60 per cent and to cut other tariffs from 35 to 60 per cent. The offer also included the reduction of the number of sensitive products to 8 per cent of tariff lines. In November, there was an agreement on the reform of the sugar sector, reducing prices by 36 per cent.</p> <p pid="c.313.0/5">In addition, some time ago, the European Union put forward the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Everything_But_Arms">Everything But Arms</a> proposals which granted free access for all products, including agricultural, to the least developed countries&#8212;the LDCs. And, of course, the European Union has strongly supported the concept of a "round for free" for the LDCs; that is, a round in which they were not expected to participate in the liberalisation and the lowering of barriers, which others, including the developing countries that are not LDCs, were expected to do.</p> <p pid="c.313.0/6">If anyone thinks that existing reforms that have already been implemented for common agricultural policy, substituting direct payments for payments dependent on the amount of production, have not had an impact, they do not have to talk to French farmers to learn that that is not the case. You do not have to go very far from this building to talk to British farmers to realise the enormous impact that that has already made. It is right to want to go further with agricultural reform, but it is neither reasonable nor realistic to expect the European Union to do so until other countries are prepared to show movement in agriculture and in other sectors such as industry, but most particularly in services. I believe that services liberalisation is massively in the interests of developing countries. It is a catalyst for growth, but so far the offers that have been put forward for the liberalisation of services, particularly but not exclusively financial services, have been wholly inadequate. There has been no readiness to move at all, and often those offers have consisted of no more than consolidating the status quo. It is a sad fact that a number of developing countries have been encouraged to reject liberalisation by many <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NGOs">NGOs</a> that ought to know better. It is an even sadder fact, I am afraid, that Her Majesty's Government have given a measure of support to this attitude.</p> <p pid="c.313.0/7">I had occasion to write to the <a href="/glossary/?gl=23" title="Secretary of State was originally the title given to the two officials who..." class="glossary">Secretary of State</a> last month on this point. I said that,</p> <p class="indent" pid="c.313.0/8">"good services are the key to development. Their absence makes development far more difficult. Any developing country economy, and the export sector in particular, must benefit from access to modern financial, professional, telecommunications, transport, infrastructure and other services, which are not available locally or not available to the extent needed. And because the provision of services normally requires a local partner and a local investment, well-paid jobs are created locally and technology and other expertise is transferred".</p> <p pid="c.313.0/9">I believe that that is a very important fact, and the reality is that the European Union will not and cannot budge further on agriculture without some indication of movement by others&#8212;not movements which are against their interests but those which are, in any realistic sense, in accordance with their interests.</p> <p pid="c.313.0/10">I also regret the fact that the European Union and United States industry sectors have not pushed governments nearly as hard as they did in the case of the Uruguay round. It may be because the economic circumstances are a little better now and they are less hungry for liberalisation. They have pushed, but they have not pushed as hard. Of course the circumstances are different from what they were at the time of the Uruguay round. It is much harder to do a deal with so many more countries involved, but the game is not over and the prize is immense. It requires cool nerves and a combination of fairness, a readiness to move at the right time and patient perseverance. I wish all involved in that difficult venture the luck they will need.</p>            </div>

                                  <div class="debate-speech__content">                <p pid="c.315.0/1">My Lords, I thank my noble friend <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lord_Radice">Lord Radice</a> for his topical report. I see that it was published only today, so it could not be more timely. I also congratulate my noble friend <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lord_Brennan">Lord Brennan</a>. He is quite right to be concerned about the prospects for <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hong_Kong">Hong Kong</a>. He is right to be concerned because this is a much more difficult round than the previous one, the Uruguay round, as the noble Lord, <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lord_Brittan">Lord Brittan</a>, pointed out. When the Uruguay round was being discussed, the commercial world was a simpler place. Countries could be much more easily characterised as "developing" or "developed"&#8212;and the round worked. Countries like India, China and Brazil emerged from the third world. Liberalisation lifted millions of their inhabitants out of poverty. Trade and aid enabled them to modernise their infrastructure, to renew their agriculture and to benefit from globalisation. They created the institutions to participate in the knowledge economy and to play an important role in world trade.</p> <p pid="c.315.0/2">Today it is much harder. Trade with developing or emerging countries means political and economic pressure not only on developed countries, but also on the poorer countries like Bangladesh or Vietnam. As my noble friend Lord Radice noted, liberalising trade in sugar will hurt the Caribbean as well as <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/East_Anglia">East Anglia</a>. So we have a fragmented negotiation: the developed world, the developing world&#8212;the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/G20">G20</a>&#8212;and the third world&#8212;the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/G90">G90</a>.</p> <p pid="c.315.0/3">In addition, we now know a lot more about the effects of trade liberalisation on weaker economies. They have suffered from enforced liberalisation in the past and the result has been instability, inequality and yet more unemployment. We also know more about the effects of protecting the affluent at home. The real cost eventually falls on the lives and standards of living of the poor in third world countries.</p> <p pid="c.315.0/4">But we know that boosting trade brings its rewards. As Ministers are constantly pointing out&#8212;as my noble friend Lord Radice pointed out&#8212;increasing Africa's share of world trade by one percentage point would deliver seven times as much benefit as it currently gets out of aid. This is a tempting prospect.</p> <p pid="c.315.0/5">So there are lots of hopes and fears riding on this meeting in Hong Kong. There is little alignment of interests between participants because the degree of development has become much more varied, particularly over agriculture. It is over agriculture, as other noble Lords have pointed out, where Hong Kong could be bogged down, but perhaps less so, as the noble Lord, Lord Brittan, explained.</p> <p pid="c.315.0/6">I should like to look beyond agriculture at trade. There seems to be little argument over whether the developed countries should liberalise their markets in favour of third world countries. The main argument seems to be centred around which are the third world countries and whether market liberalisation is good or bad for them. It seems to me that our best chance of achieving the fair and positive outcome which my noble friend Lord Brennan calls for is to try to achieve this outcome at least for the world's poorest countries, and to achieve it through trade liberalisation together with aid for trade. I say this because I believe that liberalisation as opposed to protectionism is in the best interests of even the poorest countries.</p> <p pid="c.315.0/7">Protectionism means trade barriers, and trade barriers mean a bias towards domestic markets. When India, China and Brazil were emerging they had domestic markets large enough to support businesses which could eventually compete in world markets. This is now rarely true of the poorer countries, especially those in Africa. If their businesses are to flourish, they are going to need exports. This is why Ministers have agreed that tariff reduction is a special aim of the Doha Round Market Access Negotiating Group. Trade barriers are effectively a tax on these exports, which are as likely to be sent to neighbouring countries as to developed countries. These engines of growth help to create larger regional markets and, incidentally, provide opportunities for peaceful co-existence among neighbours. These are the economies of scale which are needed to retain technological and management skills and innovation. This is why <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Latin_American">Latin American</a> and Asian countries are forming themselves into trading blocks through the regional trade agreements referred to by my noble friend Lord Brennan. This is certainly something that we need to encourage in Hong Kong.</p> <p pid="c.315.0/8">The alternative, of course, is bilateral trade deals. These tend to be more protectionist and more complicated and the weaker country is at a greater disadvantage. Anyway, it has been agreed that the Doha negotiation will end with a single package which everyone will either accept or reject. For these reasons, I think it is right to encourage poorer countries to liberalise their markets in spite of the arguments put forward by the 141 members of the Trade Justice Group.</p> <p pid="c.315.0/9">But I am against forcing liberalisation. Like my noble friend Lord Brennan, I think that hand in hand with encouraging trade liberalisation must go aid for trade, thereby building capacity to enable free trade. Indeed, the Doha declaration makes special mention of this issue and the Trade and Development Committee has a special responsibility to review it.</p> <p pid="c.315.0/10">Debt cancellation has been fundamental in that regard. It has made it easier for economic growth to be the basis for lifting people out of poverty, instead of the development diplomacy approach. Trade liberalisation of business goes with economic growth, so does building technical and managerial competence, modernising the infrastructure, and renewing agriculture to improve technical competence and enlarge export opportunities. Such social aid for trade spurs commercial business activity and helps third world countries to move into the modern knowledge economy. Incidentally, it also slows down international migration of skilled and trained personnel from third world countries.</p> <p pid="c.315.0/11">I echo the call from the Commonwealth summit for developed nations to give more than they receive in this trade round, so that the momentum towards liberalisation of trade with poorer countries is maintained&#8212;proper two-way trade, not just access such as the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Everything_But_Arms">Everything But Arms</a> agreement&#8212;because it is the best chance for lifting millions more out of property. That is the most important stated purpose of the Doha round.</p>            </div>

Not surprisingly, it has caused consternation among African, Caribbean and Pacific countries associated with the European Union, most of which stand to lose millions of pounds in the value of their exports. A similar cut is being made in the banana price.</p> <p pid="c.317.0/3">The EU Agriculture Commissioner, Mariann Fischer Boel, was quoted as saying that the new deal would make all the difference to the EU's negotiating position at the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WTO">WTO</a>. That has been echoed today. She may be right in respect of larger developing countries such as India, Brazil and Thailand, and beet farmers in Europe will be generously compensated with up to 64.2 per cent of their lost revenue, but all that will be at the expense of the ACP countries that still depend on single crops such as sugar, cotton and bananas. According to the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FAO">FAO</a>, 43 of those countries earn more than half their agricultural export revenue from a single agricultural commodity. Forty are LDCs that will have full access under the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Everything_But_Arms">Everything But Arms</a> agreement, as the noble Lord, <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lord_Brittan">Lord Brittan</a>, has mentioned, but even that concession will now be discounted in value.</p> <p pid="c.317.0/4">The sugar announcement came at an embarrassing time for Britain: just as our own <a href="/glossary/?gl=264" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prime_Minister_of_the_United_Ki ngdom" class="glossary">Prime Minister</a> was making a strong plea for trade justice at the conference. Far from expressing fair trade terms such as were envisaged at Cotonou, the European Union has settled for a temporary divide-and-rule policy in which the stronger <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/G20">G20</a> countries are placated and the weaker <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/G90">G90</a> go to the wall.</p> <p pid="c.317.0/5">The <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NGOs">NGOs</a> that belong to the trade justice campaign are naturally outraged that the European Union is adopting that stance at the expense of poorer countries. Sometimes NGOs are unfairly criticised in Parliament&#8212;we have heard it today&#8212;for being anti-liberalisation, and on occasion they appear to be against what the WTO stands for. But most development NGOs that I have worked with support the principle of free trade in the right conditions; for example, in countries such as China, which, although a poor country, can because of special circumstances stand up to the winds of globalisation. NGOs are also reminding developed countries of their obligations to their former colonies. In most cases, such associated countries have already had to be protected over a transitional period; now they are being asked, in many cases, to manage without preference and to compete directly in the marketplace. That may be possible only if they continue to receive special and differential treatment over a period. What chance does the <a href="/glossary/?gl=35" title="Ministers make up the Government and almost all are members of the House of..." class="glossary">Minister</a> think there is of this happening in Hong Kong?</p> <p pid="c.317.0/6"><a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_European_Union">The European Union</a> has designed a number of schemes to suit the ACPs and LDCs, including the Sugar Protocol, the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economic_Partnership_Agreements">Economic Partnership Agreements</a> and regional agreements. But as I said during the Commonwealth debate, the EPAs, as currently proposed, have to be WTO-compatible and must reflect reciprocity.</p> <p pid="c.317.0/7">The latest sugar agreement can only fuel the resentment of these countries and those who advocate fair trade on their behalf, who wonder, rather like the noble Lord, <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lord_Brennan">Lord Brennan</a>, whether the so-called Doha development round is still a development round at all if it cannot help the ACP and the other <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AU">AU</a> countries.</p> <p pid="c.317.0/8">Ironically, it has been shown by <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christian_Aid">Christian Aid</a> and others that a developing country which receives special treatment and continues to protect its own agriculture can benefit from investment and growth such as to prepare it better for the world market. This has happened in the case of Mozambique. I can remember from two visits how the Mozambique sugar industry was virtually destroyed during the civil war and then again during the floods of February 2000, when many cane plantations were inundated. Then another menace appeared, in the form of the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IMF">IMF</a>, which recommended that as a condition of further lending, instead of protecting the industry, Mozambique should lower its tariffs and open up to international competition. Mercifully, the World Bank, along with Mauritian and South African investors, stepped in and ultimately the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/US_Treasury">US Treasury</a> lent its weight and persuaded the fund to change its mind.</p> <p pid="c.317.0/9">Mozambique is still close to the bottom of last year's <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Nations_Human_Development_Index">United Nations Human Development Index</a>, with a life expectancy of below 40. The economy depends largely on the international financial institutions and donors, and the conditions they attach to lending, such as the national poverty reduction plan. Fortunately, the lobby was successful, and these sugar factories and plantations have now been rehabilitated, benefiting more than 20,000 people and dependants in deprived areas of the country where there is no alternative employment. As a result, the industry has received hundreds of millions of dollars in foreign investment.</p> <p pid="c.317.0/10">When people talk about the benefits of liberalisation, they forget sometimes the utter destitution of the poor in developing countries. They forget that our own infant industries had to be protected throughout the 19th century, and they overlook the fact that while we have a social security safety net for the unemployed, there is nothing like that in developing countries.</p> <p pid="c.317.0/11">I should like to quote from the statement made at the WTO last July by one of the African, Caribbean and Pacific delegates, Ambassador Ransford Smith from Jamaica. He said:</p> <p class="indent" pid="c.317.0/12">"Some . . . believe that development concerns can be taken care of merely through liberalisation, and more liberalisation, and this lays the ground for insufficient attention to issues such as the potential for harming vulnerable domestic industries, and small farmers, the under-estimating of adjustment costs and even of the potential for causing and/or deepening macro-economic imbalances. Unless we act in a focused and sympathetic way to address these matters the development aspect of the round may end up being largely in the nature of a deficit".</p> <p pid="c.317.0/13">I commend the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_Union_Committee">European Union Committee</a> report mentioned by the noble Lord, <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lord_Radice">Lord Radice</a>, for asking in paragraph 21 on page 13 for "appropriate temporary transition measures" for the least developed and the ACP countries.</p>            </div>

                                  <div class="debate-speech__content">                <p pid="c.319.0/1">My Lords, I am very pleased to follow the noble Earl. He sought to emphasise an element that we may have passed by this morning&#8212;the contribution of the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NGOs">NGOs</a>. On occasion they have a tendency to present themselves in a way where the best becomes the enemy of the good. None the less, we sometimes forget that they are very important spectators&#8212;almost participants&#8212;in this process. However, I think that recognition was given to them in the report of my noble friend <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lord_Radice">Lord Radice</a> and I congratulate the noble Lord, <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lord_Brennan">Lord Brennan</a>, on introducing this topic.</p> <p pid="c.319.0/2">I am not fully acquainted with the machinations and arcane procedures of <a href="/glossary/?gl=239" title="The House of Commons." class="glossary">this place</a> although I recognise that it is legitimate for an EU sub-committee to deal with this topic for two reasons&#8212;because the EU has responsibility as the mouthpiece for our trading interests but also, in some respects, because debates within the EU tend to mirror in one form or another debates within the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WTO">WTO</a>. Bloated agricultural interests seek to deny access to schemes that could be for the benefit of a number of people not only in the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_Community">European Community</a> but throughout the world as a whole.</p> <p pid="c.319.0/3">I am also disappointed in some ways at the short-sightedness of countries such as France and the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/USA">USA</a>. Their unwillingness either to provide access to cheaper agricultural products or to reduce in any serious way the level of subsidy has been a barrier to progress in the past. However, I agree with my <a href="/glossary/?gl=173" title="When speaking in the House of Commons, an MP will refer to an MP of the..." class="glossary">honourable friend</a>&#8212;sorry, my noble friend: he used to be my honourable friend and still is but not in any official way&#8212;that the EU tariff reduction of 38.9 per cent is a helpful step forward. I am reminded of the words of the late <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_Woodcock">George Woodcock</a> who sometimes used to refer to wage deals as shoddy, shabby compromises. While this may not be shoddy, it is certainly a wee bit shabby because I am sure that the EU, if it had the will and the guts, might have gone further, although we know about the internal debates and machinations there. These problems have to be dealt with with a degree of community-wide sensitivity.</p> <p pid="c.319.0/4">When we are talking about reductions in tariffs, we have to give due weight to the transitional arrangements that have to be made in respect of poorer countries. Reference has already been made this morning to bananas and there are too many such examples. There has to be a degree of flexibility in seeking to achieve a broader-based, rules-based trading system. Certainly, the law of unintended consequence must be taken into account at pretty well every turn.</p> <p pid="c.319.0/5">We have seen some movement in the past 12 months and it is only fair to give credit to the Government for the movement on the three-legged stool, as it were, of debt reduction, continuing and increasing aid and trying to push the issue of fair trade to the place that it now enjoys on the world's political agenda. While the WTO is often the subject of criticism, one would have to stop and say that, 10 years on, if the WTO did not exist we would have to invent it or something similar to it. I realise that we will have difficulties in the Doha round in securing both the services and agricultural elements within it. If we do not persist in that we will be faced with the alternative of bilateral agreements, which for some people can be a substitute. Indeed, it could be argued that, for some trading groups, it can be a turnkey to access to other groups&#8212;such as the bilateral that the EU enjoys with Mercosur in <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_America">South America</a>, for example. It has limited significance in some ways, but it enables the dialogue to continue.</p> <p pid="c.319.0/6">What is abundantly clear is that the absence of capability among the poorer nations means that they are unable to enter into any meaningful negotiations of a bilateral character on any basis of equality whatever. They have neither the wealth nor the capability in the form of <a href="/glossary/?gl=100" title="http://www.army.mod.uk/" class="glossary">the army</a> of civil servants that richer countries can bring to bear in the negotiating process. Indeed, it has been argued that one of the difficulties of the WTO is the strength of the strong in these discussions and the weakness of the poorer countries. However, it is encouraging&#8212;although I know for some of our negotiators it is a pain in the neck at times&#8212;that we have seen the emergence of the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/G20">G20</a>, the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/G90">G90</a> and the ACPs operating as proper units. They do not necessarily come out with the conclusions that we would like, but their interests are different from ours and they have to represent them. It is important for the credibility of the institution that within the institution these bodies emerge.</p> <p pid="c.319.0/7">When we go into these negotiations in the next few weeks, we must go in with a realistic sense of the difficulties involved&#8212;that any optimism that we have may be complicated. I remember once being told by an old WTO hand that these ministerials are somewhat similar to a game of basketball. I am always a bit leery of sporting analogies, but I shall make this fairly narrow in character. Suffice it to say that in a game of basketball, which normally lasts 60 minutes, in the first 56 minutes pretty well nothing of any significance happens; then in the last three and a half minutes all hell breaks loose, and you do not quite know what is happening. The difficulty in Cancun was that the Mexican <a href="/glossary/?gl=35" title="Ministers make up the Government and almost all are members of the House of..." class="glossary">Minister</a> called time too early; therefore, what was possible in extra time was not taken advantage of. In some respects Doha has been an attempt to limit the damage that was created at Cancun.</p> <p pid="c.319.0/8">We see a way ahead. But, to finish on a rather sombre point, if we do not get anything out of <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hong_Kong">Hong Kong</a> of a kind that will provide us with a continuing agenda into the early months of next year, we shall come up against the buffer of the United States legislative process and the fact that the fast track procedures will not necessarily be open to us in the way that they are at present. As a consequence, we might find&#8212;as we have in post-Kyoto discussions&#8212;that one of the most important players and contributors is denied access to proceedings. So we have to go with some speed. In a number of respects, this year has been a period of qualified optimism, not least because of the efforts of the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UK_Government">UK Government</a>. I am very hopeful that the impetus that our negotiators have enjoyed in other forums can be repeated in the WTO in the weeks that lie ahead.</p>            </div>

                                  <div class="debate-speech__content">                <p pid="c.321.0/1">My Lords, my noble friend <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lord_Brennan">Lord Brennan</a>, whom I congratulate on securing this splendidly timed debate and on the way he introduced it, touched on the issue of the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_Agreement_on_Trade_in_Services">General Agreement on Trade in Services</a>&#8212;<a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GATS">GATS</a>. I propose to concentrate on that, not because agriculture is not very important, but because, like my noble friend Lord O'Neill, many noble Lords have rightly focused on it&#8212;and also I have bored your Lordships quite often in the past on the subject.</p> <p pid="c.321.0/2">As the noble Lord, <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lord_Brittan">Lord Brittan</a>, said so powerfully, trade in services is increasingly important for developing countries. Even now, it provides about half their <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GDP">GDP</a>. This year's <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UNDP">UNDP</a> report says,</p> <p class="indent" pid="c.321.0/3">"poor quality services are a major constraint on human development, growth and trade".</p> <p pid="c.321.0/4"><a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_World_Bank">The World Bank</a> estimates that services liberalisation could provide up to an additional $6 trillion of income to the developing world over 2005 to 2015, which is four times what liberalisation of trade in goods might produce. Reliance on trade in raw materials, the tradition&#8212;and trap&#8212;imposed on developing countries, will not achieve anything like that, for all sorts of well known inherent and incidental reasons. More productive agriculture alone cannot do it, although it is a necessary jumping-off ground for growth because it is, uniquely, hugely labour intensive. That is one of the things that I have often said. It is the capacity to trade extensively in services that developing countries also need&#8212;and this would benefit the rest of the world as well.</p> <p pid="c.321.0/5">The key purposes of negotiation over the GATS element in the Doha round, as noble Lords know, are, roughly, to expand commitments to provide access to markets, and to reduce discrimination against foreign suppliers. It is immediately obvious that if these purposes are not differently conceived of for the developing from those for the developed world, indigenous services, the interests of the recipients and perhaps the interests of the producers of those services in developing economies are vulnerable to the greater capacity of the service entrepreneurs of the developed world.</p> <p pid="c.321.0/6">Let us take an example which has brought out perhaps the most vocal critics of the usefulness of the GATS negotiations for developing countries&#8212;water. Senegal has already decided to open up the provision of its water supply to the private sector. It is fair to say that this followed pressure from the World Bank and other donors. I am indebted here to research from the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Overseas_Development_Institute">Overseas Development Institute</a>, and I declare an interest as a council member. But the Government retained the right to set tariffs and have capped price increases at 3 per cent annually. My own experience of Senegal confirms that people believe that water is expensive, nevertheless, but&#8212;and this is a key point&#8212;90 per cent of the urban population now has access to clean piped water.</p> <p pid="c.321.0/7">I draw the following conclusions. First, it is not the GATS system of itself which forces any government to open up any market. But conditionality, for instance of the sort which used to be applied by the World Bank and even more the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IMF">IMF</a>, does do so. Secondly, prices can go up, and the Government need the capacity to regulate the tariff as well as other capacity to administer the system, and carry out the contractual negotiation in the first place. Thirdly, a government who could not provide enough clean water have now made enormous strides in the provision of a service which is essential for health and prosperity.</p> <p pid="c.321.0/8">The capacity question is one that we should consider. As many of my noble friends have said&#8212;and echoed yesterday by Professor Joseph Stiglitz, the former chief economist of the World Bank&#8212;technical assistance must go hand-in-hand with the opening up of trade for developing countries. There must be assistance for governments in the GATS negotiations themselves, in identifying areas that are important for economic growth and development, in the impact assessments that they will need to make and in the capacity to regulate and monitor private sector service delivery. Past <a href="/glossary/?gl=29" title="The Opposition are the political parties in the House of Commons other than..." class="glossary">opposition</a> criticism of DfID's use of consultants is ill placed, and I hope my noble friend can tell me that there is in fact ample provision to give developing country governments the advice that they ask for in building trade reforms into their own development plans.</p> <p pid="c.321.0/9">But progress in services negotiations has been slow. Not enough offers have been put on the table. The EC is after mandatory liberalisation targets in each country. Even though the least developed countries could be exempted, that runs quite counter to the proper sense of a market that parties are free to enter into trade as they will and only the eventual agreed contract is binding. And it would surely be damaging to push countries only just above the "least developed" line into the benchmarked list that the EC proposes, no matter what the advantage of starting negotiations from a formula. So, may I encourage my noble friend to persevere in our policy of flexibility?</p> <p pid="c.321.0/10">Finally, there is a good deal of suspicion about what GATS holds for the developing world. The confidence born of good capacity should allay some of that. But more and better offers should be made by the developed world, so that substantial new business opportunities are created in fields where developing countries can export and technology transfer can be the motor of growth. It works already fairly well with off-shoring and with tourism. It could work extremely well with temporary short-term labour migration, perhaps to the tune of over $150 billion extra income. This would be a win-win situation, because the developed economies need the lower wages, the high skills&#8212;and also the unskilled labour, which is less often talked about in the Doha context&#8212;which could be on offer. There is also huge potential for infrastructure development, the key to so much more investment.</p> <p pid="c.321.0/11">I conclude by quoting the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Development_Select_Committee">International Development Select Committee</a>'s opinion:</p> <p class="indent" pid="c.321.0/12">"If attention is paid to how GATS works in practice, it could fulfil its promise of being the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WTO">WTO</a>'s most development-friendly agreement".</p> <p pid="c.321.0/13">Sadly, few of our allies see it like that. Only Sweden, the Netherlands, Denmark, Finland and Austria have joined the UK in focusing on the development benefits of service liberalisation. The need to make progress is urgent, but, even so, progress should not be at the expense of a truly development-friendly agreement.</p>            </div>

                                  <div class="debate-speech__content">                <p pid="c.324.0/1">My Lords, I speak as a member of Sub-Committee A, and as one who participated in the preparation of the report published by that committee 18 months ago on the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WTO">WTO</a> and the role of the EU post-Cancun. That report arose from the atmosphere of gloom following the collapse of the Cancun ministerial meeting but, thanks largely to the determined efforts of <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pascal_Lamy">Pascal Lamy</a>, who was then EU Trade commissioner, and <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bob_Zoellick">Bob Zoellick</a>, his US counterpart, the Doha train had been put back on the rails. Those two gentlemen were both approaching the end of their term of office, and were determined to achieve some real progress before bowing out, a feat they achieved in the months following publication of our report, which we hope made a positive contribution to the process.</p> <p pid="c.324.0/2">Pascal Lamy was one of the most impressive witnesses we interviewed. One of the reasons for the failure at Cancun was, according to Mr Lamy, the inadequate performance of the WTO itself. He felt, for example, that the director-general of the WTO had been:</p> <p class="indent" pid="c.324.0/3">"a sort of chief clerk with no power at all".</p> <p pid="c.324.0/4">In my contribution to the debate in your Lordships' House on the sub-committee report in December a year ago, I said,</p> <p class="indent" pid="c.324.0/5">"It seems to me that Pascal Lamy would be an excellent candidate to be the next director-general".&#8212;[<a href="/search/?pop=1&s=date:20041202+column:633+section:lords"><i>Hansard</i>, 2/12/04; col. 633</a>.]</p> <p pid="c.324.0/6">I claim no credit, but I am delighted that my recommendation has been fulfilled. With Pascal Lamy in the driving seat, that particular aspect of the Cancun failure is unlikely to be repeated in <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hong_Kong">Hong Kong</a>.</p> <p pid="c.324.0/7">The role of the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/EU_Trade_Commissioner">EU Trade Commissioner</a> has been inherited by <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peter_Mandelson">Peter Mandelson</a>, who has perhaps a special interest in achieving success. He has been a driving force in the negotiations that have been going on behind the scenes in recent months to prepare the ground for Hong Kong. Indeed, he has been accused, notably by the French, of exceeding his negotiating mandate by proposing an average 38.9 per cent reduction in EU agriculture market tariffs, an accusation that has been hotly denied.</p> <p pid="c.324.0/8">Peter Mandelson has the ear of the <a href="/glossary/?gl=264" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prime_Minister_of_the_United_Ki ngdom" class="glossary">Prime Minister</a>, both personally and professionally. The Prime <a href="/glossary/?gl=35" title="Ministers make up the Government and almost all are members of the House of..." class="glossary">Minister</a> is desperate to achieve a positive verdict on the six-month British EU presidency, and December is a critical month for him, with agreements still outstanding on the budget, the financial perspective and the Doha round. In recent speeches at the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mansion_House">Mansion House</a>, to Commonwealth leaders in Malta and to the CBI, he has stressed the importance of the trade negotiations to developed, developing and less developed countries alike. At the Mansion House, he stated:</p> <p class="indent" pid="c.324.0/9">"the Doha round is an opportunity to tackle some of the most fundamental injustices at the heart of world trade".</p> <p pid="c.324.0/10">He also used the clich&#233; that has been referred to by the noble Lords, <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lord_Radice">Lord Radice</a> and <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lord_Haskel">Lord Haskel</a>:</p> <p class="indent" pid="c.324.0/11">"we know a one per cent increase in Africa's share of world trade will benefit Africa by over $70 billion, three times the aid increase agreed at Gleneagles".</p> <p pid="c.324.0/12">Even the UK budget rebate is now expressly on the negotiating table.</p> <p pid="c.324.0/13">It must be an all-time record that a report by a sub-committee, or committee, has been debated in this Chamber on the same day as its publication. In the sub-committee's report published today, we have again set out the aims and objectives for the forthcoming Hong Kong ministerial. For it to be a success it needs, at the very least, to achieve the following goals.</p> <p pid="c.324.0/14">First, a definite end-date must be agreed for the abolition of all agricultural export subsidies. Secondly, a significant reduction in agricultural tariffs by the developed countries must be agreed, with transitional compensation for less developed countries that would thereby lose existing preferential access arrangements. I hope that will be the answer to the problems raised by my noble friend <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lord_Sandwich">Lord Sandwich</a>. Thirdly, there should be a commitment to continue Doha round negotiations on further reductions in domestic agricultural support, on reduction in tariff barriers in non-agricultural markets and on opening up the global market in services. These should be completed during 2006 for the reasons expressed by several noble Lords this afternoon.</p> <p pid="c.324.0/15">This is a tall order, and a real challenge. If these objectives can be achieved, however, the ghost of Cancun can finally be laid to rest.</p>            </div>

                                  <div class="debate-speech__content">                <p pid="c.325.0/1">My Lords, my noble friends <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lord_Brennan">Lord Brennan</a> and <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lord_Radice">Lord Radice</a> are to be thanked for having so convincingly brought this vital issue before the House. I should declare an interest at the outset as a former director of Oxfam. In such organisations, it is our front-line experience of the grinding poverty that faces so much of the world's population that leads us to recognise the immense potential of the outcome of the Doha round for positive influence&#8212;or negative.</p> <p pid="c.325.0/2">The issues we are discussing offer an ethical imperative in terms of the injustice in the world today, but they also present a security imperative, because we cannot have a secure world while so many people remain desperately poor and excluded. As my noble friend Lord Radice has so rightly underlined, if multilateralism fails to deliver, the vulnerability of developing countries will be aggravated as the European Union, the United States, Japan and other rich countries turn their attention to bilateral and regional deals. Sadly, the UK's significant lead on all this has yet to be convincingly emulated by others, although I agree with those who have argued that <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peter_Mandelson">Peter Mandelson</a> is clearly doing his level best to get the European Union to perform more responsibly.</p> <p pid="c.325.0/3">Recently, Ministers seem to have acknowledged that <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hong_Kong">Hong Kong</a> is likely to be more of a progress report, with the concluding work to be completed probably in Geneva next year. There is so much at stake that transparency by governments in the extended task remains essential. The vigilance of parliaments and civil society will also be indispensable. In particular, we must beware of cynical attempts by some to divide and rule by splitting the big developing countries such as Brazil, India and China from the poorest as a means of delaying the fundamental reforms that are overdue. There has been talk of a so-called "development-friendly" package at Hong Kong. This could be useful, but I suggest it must not be a substitute for the wider strategic objectives, including, as they must, significant cuts to agricultural subsidies and tariffs.</p> <p pid="c.325.0/4">The noble Lord, Lord Cobbold, has spoken of his list of priorities. I have mine. They are not exactly the same, but some overlap. Will my noble friend assure the House that the Government endorse the following targets? First, that there must be an end-date for export subsidies and, secondly, that specific action must be taken by the United States and others to reform their subsidies&#8212;in particular, action by the US to reform the subsidies on cotton production that so badly punish the developing countries. It should never be forgotten that seven out of 10 people in the developing world are employed in agriculture. Although, as argued by the noble Earl, <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lord_Sandwich">Lord Sandwich</a>, the sugar deal is disappointing and does not send a good signal, the European Union is nevertheless to be commended on an important initiative with its agreement to negotiate an end-date to export subsidies. It is now for others to follow suit. Indeed, it is simply not acceptable for developing countries to face increased pressure to open up their markets without that happening.</p> <p pid="c.325.0/5">The third priority target on which I seek my noble friend's encouragement is meaningful market access for developing countries, including duty- and quota-free access for all LDCs. The fourth target is special and differential treatment for developing countries, including sufficient space to decide whether, when and how fast to open up their markets. There is much talk of level playing fields, but we have to remember that many people are not yet fit enough to stand on a playing field, let alone begin to play. The fifth target is the avoidance of negative trade-offs that compel developing countries to make concessions in the area of non-agricultural market access or services in exchange for any meaningful action on agriculture by the rich.</p> <p pid="c.325.0/6">On <phrase class="date" code="2005-11-25">25 November</phrase>, the director-general of the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Trade_Organisation">World Trade Organisation</a>, <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pascal_Lamy">Pascal Lamy</a>, brought out a 42-page draft for the Hong Kong summit. That draft demonstrates how much still needs to be done to salvage even a watered-down agreement. While it reflects at least some progress made by <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WTO">WTO</a> members over the past 18 months in, for example, the formulation of anti-dumping rules and measures to improve customs facilities, even at this late stage it offers no prescription for cutting tariffs and subsidies on either agricultural or manufactured goods&#8212;the two issues that have held up negotiations for many months. As things stand, the developing countries say that farm trade needs to be tackled first, because it is so important to their economies and because it remains heavily protected in many rich countries. However, the EU says that equal attention needs to be paid to manufactured goods, which far outweigh the importance of agriculture in world trade. In both areas, the director general's report fails to outline any potential agreement to reduce tariffs and slash subsidy programmes. That is no doubt because of the sharp divide between the two camps.</p> <p pid="c.325.0/7">At the same time Brazil, a major exporter of farm goods, says that the draft is not balanced because it reflects disagreements between countries and thereby plays into the hands of those who sought to stall progress in what the Brazilians see as key sectors. Does my noble friend agree that it is probably fair to conclude that the Lamy text underlines just how much rich countries&#8212;other than the United Kingdom to its credit&#8212;have been pushing their agendas and blocking progress? What can be done about that? It would be tragic, dare I say immoral, if power politics have turned upside down the promises made in Doha and if, yet again, the round is on course to benefit the rich at the expense of the poor.</p> <p pid="c.325.0/8">In talks on services, that has been all too evident. Halfway through the process, rich countries are seeking to change the rules of the game to gain additional market access, while themselves offering minimal liberalisation commitments in areas where developing countries stand to benefit. Similarly, it must be recognised that many believe that the draft text agreed in 2004 would undermine the industrialisation prospects of poor countries and therefore should be abandoned.</p> <p pid="c.325.0/9">In conclusion, does the <a href="/glossary/?gl=35" title="Ministers make up the Government and almost all are members of the House of..." class="glossary">Minister</a> agree that the worst possible outcome for the WTO process would be a bad deal that sets in tablets of stone existing trade rules, biased as they are to the already-rich, while undermining the development and global justice so essential to a decent and safer world? I very much hope that the Minister will be able convincingly to reassure us today.</p>            </div>

                                  <div class="debate-speech__content">                <p pid="c.327.0/1">My Lords, I join in thanking both my noble friends who have brought this matter before us today, and I am fortunate that I am following my noble friend <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lord_Judd">Lord Judd</a>. I am perhaps taking a slightly different view from that which some noble Lords have expressed. I recommend that some stock is taken of the broader role that the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WTO">WTO</a> should play. There was a tide of popular opinion that all trade was good. In my judgment, among all too many millions of working people that tide has ebbed, and they feel that all too often trade reduces working and living standards. A number of colleagues have touched on that. Indeed, in many countries the consensus that all trade is good for people and for development barely exists. I remind the House&#8212;because I do not think that anyone else has referred to it&#8212;that a few years ago Seattle was brought to a standstill for 36 hours by working people protesting over the goings-on at the WTO.</p> <p pid="c.327.0/2">At <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hong_Kong">Hong Kong</a> or later we have to turn that around. We need to reconnect with the people, reassert the case for free trade in a convincing way and examine why, among so many millions, they do not really believe it. That would have to mean some real change. I ask my friends to consider the position of the world's clothing and textile producers. They are, in the main, in the world's poorest countries. They are still reeling from the rude shock delivered by the end of quotas at the beginning of this year. For the workers&#8212;often poor women who have lost their jobs&#8212;for their communities and for their countries' economies the benefits of trade liberalisation are very hard indeed to comprehend.</p> <p pid="c.327.0/3">We then need to look at the whole basis for the current negotiations. In many respects it is flawed, because no meaningful impact assessment is carried out on the consequences that are likely to follow from decisions that are taken. Not only is that graphically demonstrated by the textiles chaos to which I referred earlier, but it is all too clear from the position in which the ACP countries find themselves following the sugar changes. I am sorry that my noble friend <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lord_Haskel">Lord Haskel</a> has misjudged it, because the cane sugar countries are in a very serious bind indeed.</p> <p pid="c.327.0/4">We should consider the ways in which there should be some change. We need to move away from the dogma that trade liberalisation will automatically boost economic growth, reduce poverty and hence improve people's lives. That is an ideological approach that we all want to believe, but when you get on the ground it just is not true&#8212;often it is, often it is not. You can find its result in the many areas of child labour, slavery&#8212;not least near-slavery in Brazil, as has been mentioned&#8212;discrimination and unsafe conditions. That should not be acceptable. Work is a concept that includes respect for workers' rights, equality between men and women, social protection, social dialogue, job creation and decent work. There are no mechanisms in the WTO whereby any of that can follow.</p> <p pid="c.327.0/5">The <a href="/glossary/?gl=35" title="Ministers make up the Government and almost all are members of the House of..." class="glossary">Minister</a> should put down a marker. The WTO must recognise those issues and pay them attention. Ideally, I would like to see in the final statement that they will address those issues on an ongoing basis or consider how they may be addressed. The WTO&#8212;and perhaps we here&#8212;might usefully consider some form of inter-institutional coherence, because there is very little. Two noble Lords referred to that. When we have a debate again on the WTO, it might well embrace some of the impact that we get from the other two international institutions.</p> <p pid="c.327.0/6">Globalisation is here, and here to stay. We are far from catching up with its consequences; certainly that is true of the international institutions. I hope that the outcome at Hong Kong will be more successful than not, even if it means that some issues are deferred. But if the issues that I and others have raised in relation to the consequences of unfettered free trade are to be addressed, it could well make a happier climate, particularly for those countries that are not in the happy position in which we are in Europe.</p>            </div>

                                  <div class="debate-speech__content">                <p pid="c.328.0/1">My Lords, this year has seen very welcome attention from the media and the public for international development issues. The noble Lords, <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lord_Brennan">Lord Brennan</a> and <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lord_Radice">Lord Radice</a>, are certainly sailing with the wind in bringing these important issues to our attention this morning. We are all in favour of making poverty history now. The <a href="/glossary/?gl=264" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prime_Minister_of_the_United_Ki ngdom" class="glossary">Prime Minister</a> and the <a href="/glossary/?gl=99" title="The chancellor of the exchequer is the government's chief financial..." class="glossary">Chancellor of the Exchequer</a> certainly deserve credit for the focus of the British presidency of the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/G8">G8</a> on development, specifically for Africa. We should also acknowledge that significant progress was made at Gleneagles. The deal on debt cancellation was a serious step forward for the countries concerned, and all the promises to increase aid by 2010 should be welcomed&#8212;if all countries live up to the promises that they made. But I am sure that noble Lords will agree that that was the minimum required to claim any kind of success in dealing with world poverty, and serious deficiencies remain. Certainly the tenor of noble Lords' speeches is that we accept now that aid alone is not enough.</p> <p pid="c.328.0/2">In the long term, the less developed countries will succeed only through sustainable economic growth and development based on a proper balance between free and fair trade, particularly through the opening up of western markets to developing countries, which is what the Doha round is fundamentally about. I was intrigued by the remarks of the noble Lord, Lord Christopher, because the argument in the United Kingdom in favour of free trade has long been won so far as I am concerned. Indeed, one might argue that the debate over free trade as against protectionism that prevailed in this House and <a href="/glossary/?gl=112" title="During a debate members of the House of Commons traditionally refer to the..." class="glossary">another place</a> over the past 150 years probably has a significant role in establishing why the noble Baroness, Lady Miller, the noble Lord, Lord Sainsbury, and I sit where we do, and in the <a href="/glossary/?gl=43" title="The House of Commons votes by dividing. Those voting Aye (yes) to any..." class="glossary">division</a> of our political parties in the battles over the past century. However, the battle has intellectually been won in the United Kingdom.</p> <p pid="c.328.0/3">If I doubted that, those doubts were certainly removed when I turned on the radio and listened to the director-general of the CBI, Sir Digby Jones, talking on the "Today" programme at the height of what became known as the bra wars. Noble Lords will realise that the argument was about tariff protection for certain textile exports from China. Which director-general of the CBI has gone on the "Today" programme before and said that it was important that the issue was resolved not because we needed to protect our textile manufacturers, but because Marks &amp; Spencer needed protection and needed the bras and knickers released? That was the moment at which I realised that the free trade and consumer argument in the UK had finally been won. As always on these issues, however, the devil is in the detail, and in <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Trade_Organisation">World Trade Organisation</a> matters there is an awful lot of devil and an awful lot of detail.</p> <p pid="c.328.0/4">The first problem, of which all noble Lords are aware, is that at present richer countries impose a great number of restrictions and high tariff barriers for imports of commodities in which the poorer nations tend to specialise&#8212;for example, certain agricultural goods and low-value manufactured goods such as textiles. Those barriers clearly prevent the poorest countries properly benefiting from exports of the few products in which they have a comparative advantage.</p> <p pid="c.328.0/5">In the debate, we have tended to focus on agriculture, as does the Doha round. That is not surprising, because three-quarters of the world's poor live in rural areas and, in developing countries, agriculture accounts for an average of 27 per cent of <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GDP">GDP</a> and export earnings, and almost half the employment. In rich countries, particularly the European Union, agriculture accounts for a mere 2 per cent of GDP. There is something strange in our agriculture markets being the most heavily protected. Tariff levels in <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OECD">OECD</a> countries are on average 12 times the rate for industrial products, and $1 billion a day is spent subsidising agriculture in developed countries. For us in the UK, the irony is that the European Union's common agricultural policy subsidies often seem to be hijacked by the large retailers and supermarkets, so we have the worst of every world. Farming remains in crisis and British consumers still pay over the odds.</p> <p pid="c.328.0/6">If the Doha round is lost, it could undo the modest good done by promises of aid coming down the track, because the issue is much more fundamental for the developing countries than aid. Noble Lords referred earlier to the fact that the European Union concessions, which appear essential to the success of the Doha round, represent an absolute minimum if the talks are to proceed. If we could abolish trade barriers and end export-dumping by rich countries, that would clearly allow the developing world's farmers and traders access to first-world markets and enable them to develop their own enterprises profitably. In that way, developing countries can build up their infrastructure and improve the standard of living in their population in the long term, a goal that aid alone cannot achieve.</p> <p pid="c.328.0/7">A number of issues that are causing severe problems for some underdeveloped countries are swirling around the Doha talks, and I would like to touch on them. First, the amount of liberalisation of markets that will be imposed on the so-called third world is under discussion. Noble Lords should be aware that the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_Agreement_on_Trade_in_Services">General Agreement on Trade in Services</a> contains nothing that forces developing countries to liberalise or privatise. It was agreed as long ago as 2004 that the least developed countries should receive special treatment. However, I am not clear that the World Trade Organisation is taking that point on board in the Doha round.</p> <p pid="c.328.0/8">Secondly, there is the question of special assistance for poorer countries. As noble Lords will be aware, 38 of the 148 countries around the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WTO">WTO</a> table are least developed countries&#8212;LDCs in the jargon&#8212;and as the gap between rich and poor has continued to widen, it is the LDCs that have become increasingly marginalised from the global economy. The Doha round may well benefit Brazil and other countries of similar economic power, but it is vital that it give proper concern to the position of the LDCs, because there is a danger that they will miss out.</p> <p pid="c.328.0/9">Whatever the difficulties, it is clearly essential that the Doha round succeed. First, there is a clear and powerful moral case for Europe and the United States to open up their markets to developing countries, particularly in agricultural products. Secondly, it must be in our enlightened self-interest to break the culture of protectionism that holds back development in Africa and slows growth in Europe. Thirdly, a failure of the round would put at risk the whole structure of multilateral organisations. It must be the best approach to have multilateral organisations, and it is in no one's interests for the WTO to founder. A multilateral-rule system must be the best approach, otherwise we will have the awful alternative of pursuing the growing trend towards bilateral and regional deals, which clearly disadvantage developing countries that lack the capacity to strike a good deal.</p>            </div>

                                  <div class="debate-speech__content">                <p pid="c.331.0/1">My Lords, I congratulate the noble Lord, <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lord_Brennan">Lord Brennan</a>, on initiating this debate, which comes on the eve of the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hong_Kong">Hong Kong</a> round, and also on introducing it so well. It has also been helpful to your Lordships that the European Committee's report in anticipation of the Hong Kong ministerial meeting has been made available today, and I thank the noble Lord, <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lord_Radice">Lord Radice</a>, for his clear explanation of it.</p> <p pid="c.331.0/2">The <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WTO">WTO</a> negotiations have generated much political hope and much high-sounding rhetoric, but without, so far, producing much of a result for the people whom they are supposed to help. I remind your Lordships that the WTO derives its ancestry from the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_Agreement_on_Tariffs_and_Trade">General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade</a>&#8212;<a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GATT">GATT</a>&#8212;as long ago as 1948. That was supposed to be a temporary measure to pave the way for an international trade organisation. However, its charter was never ratified, and it was only after an endless series of negotiations at various places around the world that the WTO was established. That was in the Uruguay round, which itself lasted for no less that eight years from 1986 to 1994.</p> <p pid="c.331.0/3">The current round of negotiations began in 2001 and, in my opinion, I regret to say, there is little prospect of a major breakthrough this time either. A cynic would say that all these convoluted debates are an example of international nimbyism. Everyone is agreed that free trade&#8212;or even freer trade&#8212;would help to lift undeveloped countries out of poverty and, in some cases, famine. However, individual countries&#8212;whether it is France protecting its grossly inefficient farmers or the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/USA">USA</a>, whose every president is in thrall to the powerful agricultural, steel and manufacturing industries&#8212;while paying lip service to the concept of reducing protectionism and unfair export subsidies, argue that they should be exempt. I only mention those two countries as examples. The truth is that every country has its own particular niche to protect, and I cannot view with any optimism the possibility of either a great leap forward at Hong Kong, or even a meaningful first step, despite the high-flown rhetoric of the participating governments. Persuading governments to stop trying to protect their own indigenous industries and farmers, is, to quote the well-known clich&#233;, like trying to get turkeys to vote for Christmas. I certainly hope that I am not being too pessimistic.</p> <p pid="c.331.0/4">An outline deal was scheduled for this July, ahead of the forthcoming Hong Kong meeting. However, deadlock over&#8212;your Lordships have guessed it&#8212;agriculture meant that there was no outline deal that just needed some tidying up in Hong Kong. The noble Lord, Lord Brennan, mentioned that. The Doha agreement said, in effect, that everything must be agreed, or nothing is agreed. I note that the noble Lord, Lord Radice, said that if we were to get there by the end of 2006, we need to get a move on. It seems that Hong Kong is going to try to reach partial agreements wherever there is a consensus and to set a new deadline for full agreement. The noble Lord, Lord Radice, used the word "modalities", although I was not quite sure what that meant. In other words, the apparent objective at Hong Kong will be to cobble together an agreement on what is to be agreed in the future. I believe that the noble Lord, Lord Radice, said the same thing, but in much more elegant and tactful language.</p> <p pid="c.331.0/5">As the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_Union_Committee">European Union Committee</a>'s report forcefully points out,</p> <p class="indent" pid="c.331.0/6">"it is clear that an agreement on <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NAMA">NAMA</a>"&#8212; non-agricultural market access&#8212;</p> <p class="indent" pid="c.331.0/8">"remains a long way off because there is an objection from developing countries to opening up their . . . markets".</p> <p pid="c.331.0/9">The committee's report also points out that agreement on services seems unlikely to be reached in Hong Kong. Both my noble friend <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lord_Brittan">Lord Brittan</a> and the noble Baroness, Lady Whitaker, spoke of the importance of getting something to happen with the service industries. The committee urges countries at least to set a target date to make their best and final offers on this important aspect, which is vital to the EU, because 69 per cent of EU economy is based on services. Even as recently as last October, the EU and the United States were proposing separate and different solutions to the question of agricultural liberalisation, covering market access and domestic subsidies. Even within the EU, some member states are described as being unhappy, notably France. There are also differences between the EU and the United States over services and industrial products.</p> <p pid="c.331.0/10">We also have to ask what the attitude of China will be to the constraints that the WTO will seek to apply to its emerging giant economy. So far, its attitude to issues such as counterfeiting and copyright piracy does not give rise to much optimism. How enthusiastically will EU negotiators press the line that our Government have taken? I quote none other than the <a href="/glossary/?gl=99" title="The chancellor of the exchequer is the government's chief financial..." class="glossary">Chancellor of the Exchequer</a>, speaking before the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/G8">G8</a> conference in June, who said:</p> <p class="indent" pid="c.331.0/11">"We cannot any longer ignore what people in the poorest countries will see as our hypocrisy of developed country protectionism".</p> <p pid="c.331.0/12">I raise this because of different attitudes in different statements by Ministers. In an open letter to the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trade_Justice_Movement">Trade Justice Movement</a>, the <a href="/glossary/?gl=23" title="Secretary of State was originally the title given to the two officials who..." class="glossary">Secretary of State</a> for <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trade_and_Industry">Trade and Industry</a> used emotive phrases such as, "no forced liberalisation", a policy which he said the Government supported. In a speech to the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foreign_Policy_Centre">Foreign Policy Centre</a> on <phrase class="date" code="2005-10-20">20 October</phrase>, he said,</p> <p class="indent" pid="c.331.0/13">"We must not prevent developing countries engaging in deals that could offer huge opportunities. Instead we should pursue policies that require less liberalisation from them than we concede to them".</p> <p pid="c.331.0/14">The <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DTI">DTI</a> <a href="/glossary/?gl=220" title="A document issued by the Government laying out its policy, or proposed..." class="glossary">White Paper</a>, which the CBI supported, stated:</p> <p class="indent" pid="c.331.0/15">"The evidence shows that those countries which have achieved the biggest reductions of poverty in recent years have been those that have been open to international trade".</p> <p pid="c.331.0/16">That statement is totally inconsistent with the two passages I have just quoted.</p> <p pid="c.331.0/17">Has the Government's policy changed? If it has, when did that happen? What signal do the two statements give about what the Government are going to concede in Hong Kong without getting anything in return? The fact is that developing countries and less-developed countries are constructing and maintaining barriers, even between themselves, but, in a perfect world, seeking international co-operation while looking after number one cannot be the right attitude. But then we do not live in a perfect world, do we? We shall no doubt find that out when we witness the deliberations at Hong Kong.</p> <p pid="c.331.0/18"><a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_CBI">The CBI</a> pointed out to the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secretary_of_State">Secretary of State</a> in response to his open letter that,</p> <p class="indent" pid="c.331.0/19">"it is essential to recognise that British exporters face significant barriers to trade, including high tariffs, trade restrictions and bureaucracy. These trade barriers benefit no-one and their reduction or elimination would boost UK economic growth. For British companies providing commercial services, significant discrimination and restrictions remain in overseas markets".</p> <p pid="c.331.0/20">We strongly support a policy of reducing trade barriers to assist poorer countries, but I trust and hope that in the discussions in Hong Kong, the <a href="/glossary/?gl=264" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prime_Minister_of_the_United_Ki ngdom" class="glossary">Prime Minister</a> will, in deciding what concessions to make, remember that there is always a price to pay, and that these negotiations must be proper negotiations with give and take.</p> <p pid="c.331.0/21">I, too, should mention the much-trumpeted recent reduction of sugar subsidies that has been watered down from a proposed reduction of 39 per cent over two years, to 36 per cent over four years. That was raised by the noble Earl, <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lord_Sandwich">Lord Sandwich</a>, and the noble Lord, <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lord_Haskel">Lord Haskel</a>. I am reminded of the apocryphal prayer, "Lord, make me good, but not just yet". The same applies to the agreement by the EU in 2002 to reduce <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CAP">CAP</a> subsidies. But after the inevitable internal disagreements, spending on CAP is to remain the same until 2013. Even then, according to Oxfam, the proposals will not make a big enough difference and that overproduction will result in the equally objectionable process of dumping.</p> <p pid="c.331.0/22">My <a href="/glossary/?gl=172" title="When speaking in the House of Commons, an MP will refer to another MP of..." class="glossary">right honourable friend</a> the <a href="/glossary/?gl=175" title="The &quot;Leader of the Opposition&quot; is head of &quot;Her Majesty's Official..." class="glossary">Leader of the Opposition</a> said last April:</p> <p pid="c.331.0/23">"The potential [of the WTO] to help the poorest countries of the world is not being realised. The developed countries are still too protectionist. Western tariffs and farm subsidies reduce the export earnings of developing countries by . . . $39 billion a year, 50 per cent more than they receive in aid".</p> <p pid="c.331.0/24">I speak of "hope". We can only hope that the outcome of the forthcoming round of negotiations in Hong Kong will in fact reach a high proportion of the objectives set for them. It is also to be hoped that progress will be made in the field of non-trade concerns, such as environmental protection, food security and rural development. And, personally, I can only hope that when we come to discuss the outcome of those talks, as we surely shall after they conclude, my admittedly pessimistic views will be proved to be unfounded and I shall be able to congratulate the Government and the other participants at Hong Kong on a positive result.</p>            </div>

                                  <div class="debate-speech__content">                <p pid="c.334.0/1">My Lords, I am delighted to take part in this debate today. I thank my noble friend <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lord_Brennan">Lord Brennan</a> for raising this issue at such a critical time. The next major milestone in the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DDA">DDA</a>&#8212;the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hong_Kong">Hong Kong</a> ministerial conference&#8212;is less than two weeks away. I also thank my noble friend <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lord_Radice">Lord Radice</a> for the excellent report of the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_Union_Committee">European Union Committee</a> into prospects for the ministerial conference.</p> <p pid="c.334.0/2">We all know how important the DDA is. The stakes are high. Trade increases prosperity, and prosperity gives people and nations a stake in the future. This round has the potential to deliver more than $200 billion in global gains. As my noble friend <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lord_Haskel">Lord Haskel</a> pointed out, the UK has used its two presidencies this year to focus attention on Africa, and we should continue to do so in Hong Kong. The figure that I have is slightly different from that quoted by my noble friend Lord Radice but I think that it is the same as that given by the noble Lord, Lord Cobbold. It is that a 1 per cent increase in Africa's share of world trade would benefit Africa by more than $70 billion, and that is three times the aid increase agreed at Gleneagles. But the point is the same.</p> <p pid="c.334.0/3">Developing countries could gain $47 billion in increased agricultural exports. But it is not just the poor countries of the world that will benefit from a comprehensive and ambitious Doha round. From non-agricultural market access alone, Europe could gain &#8364;20 billion a year.</p> <p pid="c.334.0/4">The <a href="/glossary/?gl=264" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prime_Minister_of_the_United_Ki ngdom" class="glossary">Prime Minister</a>, in his speech on <phrase class="date" code="2005-11-14">14 November</phrase>, emphasised that an ambitious trade deal is a priority for the UK. We need a comprehensive, ambitious agreement to cut barriers to trade in the three key areas: agriculture, non-agricultural market access and services. The aim of the Hong Kong ministerial conference must be to create the conditions so that, by the end of 2006, we can get there.</p> <p pid="c.334.0/5">In Geneva tomorrow, the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WTO">WTO</a> membership is set to agree the texts to take to Hong Kong. Over the past month, <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pascal_Lamy">Pascal Lamy</a>, the WTO director-general, has been managing expectations for Hong Kong. Key WTO members remain some distance apart on important areas, and Lamy has stated that his overriding aim is to ensure that Hong Kong is not a failure. He also wants to ensure that an agreement there locks any progress that has been made since the framework agreement last summer. That approach will, in all likelihood, mean that another ministerial conference early next year&#8212;commonly referred to as "Hong Kong 2"&#8212;will be needed to finalise dates and figures.</p> <p pid="c.334.0/6">In this vein, chairs across the different areas of negotiation have produced reports that summarise the state of negotiations and provide some tentative suggestions of areas of possible convergence. Consistent with their mandate, there are few surprises in the reports. This is a low-risk strategy, which has the advantage of lowering the chances of a repeat of Cancun. But the critical question will be whether Hong Kong can set up the conditions for conclusion next year. That is why, as I will mention in a few moments, we will continue to press WTO members to keep expectations high for Hong Kong. The agreed texts need to be the starting point for negotiations at the ministerial conference&#8212;not the negotiations' end point.</p> <p pid="c.334.0/7">A successful Hong Kong will require progress across the breadth of the DDA negotiations. Much time and energy is focused on agricultural negotiations, and I thank my noble friend Lady Whitaker for reminding us of the importance of services to developing countries. She is correct in identifying that technical assistance must go hand in hand with opening trade to developing countries.</p> <p pid="c.334.0/8">Noble Lords may be interested to learn about three projects that the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UK_Government">UK Government</a> are funding to increase trade capacity in services. The first, which is being carried out by <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UNCTAD">UNCTAD</a>, is aimed at assisting the integration of developing countries in global services trade through ensuring adequate impact assessments of developing country import and export interests. That is a crucial tool in helping developing countries to negotiate from a position of informed strength.</p> <p pid="c.334.0/9">The second is a capacity-building project, undertaken by UNCTAD and the World Bank, which is focused on expanding developing country capacity to negotiate and schedule meaningful requests and offers. It is a technical issue that requires particular expertise and experience.</p> <p pid="c.334.0/10">The third is a specific commitment to the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_African_Government">South African Government</a> from the UK Government to provide &#163;100,000 to aid consultation between ministries, regulators, business and consumers to assist in assessing when, where and how to open up the domestic service sector to foreign competition. This serves to illustrate that the Government are committed to providing developing countries with the tools that they need to participate effectively in trade negotiations. Developing countries are increasingly telling us that, together with financial assistance, they require assistance in gathering knowledge and understanding of their own domestic industries to build negotiating capacity. More generally, development is at the heart of the UK's distinctive trade philosophy, as set out in the July 2004 <a href="/glossary/?gl=220" title="A document issued by the Government laying out its policy, or proposed..." class="glossary">White Paper</a>, <i>Making Globalisation a <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Force_for_Good">Force for Good</a></i>.</p> <p pid="c.334.0/11">A key element of the development debate, on which the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Make_Poverty_History">Make Poverty History</a> campaign this year has concentrated and which my noble friend Lord Haskel covered so eloquently, is the extent to which developing countries should be forced to liberalise. Liberalisation has the potential to deliver huge gains for both developed and developing countries. But if it is done too quickly, it can be disruptive, as was seen with the shock treatment meted out by the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IMF">IMF</a> and the World Bank in the 1980s. I agree with my noble friend Lord Haskel that we should make the case for liberalisation to developing countries. Liberalisation is not only a north-south issue; it is also a south-south issue.</p> <p pid="c.334.0/12">It should also be said that liberalisation and increased prosperity never come without some economic disruption. However, I am afraid that I cannot agree with the comments of the noble Lord, Lord Christopher, about free trade and textiles trade. If you look across the world, you will see the huge benefits that have come to many developing countries, such as Vietnam, China and Bangladesh&#8212;some of the world's poorest countries&#8212;from being able to access markets in Europe with their products. I would argue that the disruption that we have seen recently comes mainly from the fact that we have maintained protection in Europe for too long. Suddenly removing that protection brings with it obvious economic disruption.</p> <p pid="c.334.0/13">I agree with my noble friend Lord Haskel that we should make the case for liberalisation in developing countries, but it is for developing countries to make their own decisions on the timing, pace, sequencing and product coverage of any market opening in line with their own national development plans and poverty reduction strategies.</p> <p pid="c.334.0/14">As we have set out, we will not force liberalisation on developing countries through aid conditionality or trade negotiations. We should move away from a mindset where market opening by developed countries is seen as a "concession" to be traded for access to developing country markets. I hope that that nuanced and carefully balanced policy is now clear to the noble Baroness, Lady Miller.</p> <p pid="c.334.0/15">I also want to use this opportunity to mention aid-for-trade proposals, which the Government have done so much to advance through the Gleneagles Summit. As set out in the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commission_for_Africa">Commission for Africa</a> report, it is not enough for poor countries to have increased access to markets abroad. They also need support to build the capacity to take advantage of those new trading opportunities. The EU is the biggest provider of trade-related assistance worldwide by far. Earlier this year, <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/President_Barroso">President Barroso</a> pledged to increase aid for trade to &#8364;1 billion a year, and last month the Prime <a href="/glossary/?gl=35" title="Ministers make up the Government and almost all are members of the House of..." class="glossary">Minister</a> pledged to treble UK trade-related aid to &#163;100 million a year by 2010. We will be pressing others to make similar pledges to help to ensure that poorer countries gain from the Doha agreement.</p> <p pid="c.334.0/16">Before I turn to what the Government are doing to help to ensure a successful outcome at Hong Kong, I would like to comment on the excellent report on prospects for the ministerial conference produced by the European Union Committee. As it was published only today, I will not make a detailed response. However, I wish to compliment noble Lords on the production of a timely report and give my broad support to their conclusions. In particular, I welcome the call to end export subsidies by 2010 and to agree a date for final offers on services.</p> <p pid="c.334.0/17">In terms of negotiating dynamics, it is clear that developed countries must play a leading role in removing their trade distorting support. But, as the report and the noble Lords, Lord Brennan and <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lord_Brittan">Lord Brittan</a>, point out, advanced developing countries such as Brazil and India also now need to play their part. The state of negotiations makes it clear that all parties need to turn over their cards in the next few weeks and months.</p> <p pid="c.334.0/18">The Government are working hard to deliver a successful outcome to the DDA. As we are all aware, the UK is an active player in trade policy and champion of the multilateral trading system. <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_UK">The UK</a> has continued to play an active role in the EU and beyond. The UK has consistently made the case for bold steps in DDA negotiations, such as the EU's offer in May 2004 to eliminate export subsidies. And we will be using our presidency of the EU to help to deliver a progressive European position at Hong Kong.</p> <p pid="c.334.0/19">The UK has used its presidency of the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/G8">G8</a> in 2005 to highlight aid, trade and debt. A statement on trade at Gleneagles in July helped to display the level of commitment from world leaders to an ambitious conclusion to the DDA and highlighted the need for aid for trade for poorer countries. The UK has also been making the case for the development of an effective package of trade-related technical assistance and capacity building to help unlock the development benefits offered by the DDA.</p> <p pid="c.334.0/20">We will maintain this effort and continue to press other WTO members to work together for as much progress as possible in Hong Kong. We must see agreement to a package that will allow conclusion of the round by 2006 and which both genuinely delivers on development and helps to build a more competitive European economy. As my noble friend Lord Radice said, that is essential as US fast-track authority expires in 2007. We have a strong team heading out to Hong Kong headed by the <a href="/glossary/?gl=23" title="Secretary of State was originally the title given to the two officials who..." class="glossary">Secretary of State</a> for <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trade_and_Industry">Trade and Industry</a>, accompanied by the Secretaries of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs and International Development and the Minister for Trade.</p> <p pid="c.334.0/21">I shall now deal with the few specific points that were raised during the debate. My noble friend Lord Brennan spoke of the cotton initiative. Cotton is a key example of a crop where unfair competition from subsidised production, predominately in the US but also in the EU, is undermining the development potential of competitive cotton farmers in west Africa. The development impact of cotton subsidies is widely acknowledged and the subject of a special initiative in the WTO, driven by four west African LDCs, Benin, Burkina Faso, Chad and Mali. The UK strongly supports the EU proposed fast-track initiative in the WTO on cotton to eliminate all trade-distorting support given to producers in developing countries and to offer duty-free access to the least developed countries. Progress has been slow and at Hong Kong we want to see progress on the WTO cotton sector initiative.</p> <p pid="c.334.0/22">The noble Earl, <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lord_Sandwich">Lord Sandwich</a>, spoke about the sugar regime. The sugar regime has not been reformed for more than 40 years and European sugar prices are three times world levels. We do not have a choice on this issue. Reform is necessitated by a WTO panel ruling on a case brought by Australia, Brazil and Thailand. ACP producers will still enjoy European prices at two times world levels. I have a certain sympathy with <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peter_Mandelson">Peter Mandelson</a>'s statement that he is pressurised to liberalise agriculture and then criticised when the Commission does so. We need, as the UK is doing, to push for an adequate transitional package for those countries affected. Adequate transitional assistance is necessary to send the right message to the ACP ahead of Hong Kong.</p> <p pid="c.334.0/23">My noble friend <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lord_Judd">Lord Judd</a> had a list of relevant and important questions. I shall deal with them quickly. First, on the end date for export subsidies, we totally agree with that. Government policy is to agree an end date of 2010 for agricultural export subsidies and we shall press for solution of that issue at Hong Kong. Secondly, he asked about action on subsidies, especially on cotton. I have already dealt with cotton in that regard and we support the Commission proposal to fast track implementation of commitments on cotton. Thirdly, he asked about increased market access, particularly duty-free and quota-free access for LDCs. Yes, we agree on that. The <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Everything_But_Arms">Everything But Arms</a> agreement of 2001 granted duty-free and quota-free access to the EU and we shall be pressing all developed and developing countries in a position to do so to follow suit. Fourthly, he mentioned special and differential treatment for developing countries. We agree that special and differential treatment is a crucial element of negotiations. As the Government have set out, we will not force liberalisation through either aid conditionality or trade negotiations, allowing developing countries to plan and sequence reforms. Finally, he asked about the move away from the culture of trade-offs in negotiations. In the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_Paper">White Paper</a> of 2004 the UK Government rejected a mercantilist approach of treating reforms as concessions to be traded off. The noble Lord is correct in saying that the UK is a minority in that regard.</p> <p pid="c.334.0/24">The reality in Geneva, as noble Lords have recognised, is that all members need to use Lamy's phrase, to share the political pain. There is agreement that developed countries should take most of the pain but advanced developing countries need to show their willingness to make some limited movement as well. Is a bad deal worse than no deal? We should remember that we have seen substantial progress on delivering the Doha mandate. We must not overlook that. The EU has offered to reduce its trade distorting domestic support by 70 per cent and average tariffs by 38.9 per cent. The deal must deliver on development and the voting arrangement of one member one vote means that a deal that does not deliver on development could be vetoed by any of the 149 members.</p> <p pid="c.334.0/25">What can we realistically expect Hong Kong to deliver? Your Lordships will have seen the push to reduce the ambitions for the Hong Kong conference. We are uncomfortable with that. The 2006 deadline remains. The same politicians will be in the same seats next year. It is hard to see how conditions early next year will be better than they are now. The bottom line is that some tough political decisions have to be made and we are pressing for them to be taken at Hong Kong. At Hong Kong the easy choice will be a lowest-common-denominator outcome. We need to aim higher&#8212;much higher indeed. All WTO members need to make a huge effort to get the process back on track. No one wants Hong Kong to fail and, most importantly, very few want to reduce the level of ambition for the round, but if we are to succeed it will require more than good will and ambition. It will also require vision, enlightened self-interest and the willingness of all countries to take tough decisions.</p>            </div>

The main theme of our debate has reflected sensible realism rather than undue pessimism.</p> <p pid="c.339.2/2">In conclusion, there are three things that are significant for us as a trading country. The first is the development objective of Doha. <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Chinese">The Chinese</a> are not given to overstatement or to ill-judged words, and the chairman of the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WTO">WTO</a> conference in China said:</p> <p class="indent" pid="c.339.2/3">"This is after all a development round, and if we aren't able to do something significant in development it really becomes meaningless".</p> <p pid="c.339.2/4">Doha was a promise from the developed to the developing countries. To deliver it inadequately would be bad. To deliver it not at all would be unacceptable.</p> <p pid="c.339.2/5">My second point is on the coincidence of international and British trading interests. Most developing countries want agricultural reform. So do we. Most developing countries will accept trade in services, provided it is reasonably sequenced and local interests are looked after. So do we. As the noble Lord, <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lord_Brittan">Lord Brittan</a>, and my noble friend Lady Whitaker pointed out, nearly half of our exports are dedicated to services. We should play our full part; if agriculture opens the door in negotiations, we should follow up with services. They work abroad to give stability and help the fight against corruption.</p> <p pid="c.339.2/6">My last point is about the Government's policy. I commend it. It echoes the phrase used in this Motion, "fair and positive". I hope that it continues, always with a delicate equipoise between patience and determination, and always punctilious to fulfil British and international fair trading objectives. I beg leave to withdraw the Motion for Papers.</p>            </div>
